The patient had no complaint of dyspnea or cough. Physical examination revealed clear breathing sound without crackles or wheezing. However low hemoglobin was noted on 8\/30 2U pRBC with Lasix were given on that day followed by increased urine output. Thus we started regular diuretics as a help for renal function recovery. Under stable fluid status thalium scan was done smoothly on 8\/31 and revealed probable mild stress-induced ischemia at mid anteroseptal apical lateral and apical inferior walls. Cardiologists were consulted. Owing to negative (treadmill ECG) and mildly positive (thallium scan) non-invasive testing coronary angiography is not advised. Evaluation of iron profile HIV screen serum protein EP ANA was carried out pending results. Also we added Dilatrend titrating gradually and tapering Doxaben adn Norvasc as suggested. Tenchoff catheter implantaton is scheduled on 9\/08 for long term PD. During the meantime he ketp hemodialysis via double lumen smoothly.","last_weekly_brief_summary":"After transferal on 8\/16 NTG pump was kept and anti-hypertensive agents were added sequentially for blood pressure control. Diuretics sodium bicarbonate and calcium supplement were titrated for chronic kidney disease. Cefepime was added for suspected occult infection. Flotrac was applied for hemodynamic monitoring. Bedside echo showed IVC diameter 1.7cm without collapsibility A profile over bilateral lung fields and no pleural effusion. CV specialist was consulted for HFrEF and acute decompensated heart failure who suggested adding vasodilators to decrease afterload. The blood pressure and the SVRI gradually decreased. NTG pump was discontinued on 8\/18. Concor was added on 8\/20.\n\nHowever an episode of breakthrough fever with transient hypotension and drowsiness developed on 8\/18. Urinanalysis revealed pyuria. Urinary tract infection was favored so Cefepime was shifted to Tazocin empirically for Enterococcus coverage. Also slow response and intermittent limb twitching were noted. Follow-up lab data also showed progressive azotemia elevating creatinine and hypocalcemia. Uremic encephalopathy was suspected. Nephrologist was consulted on 8\/19 who suggested medical treatment first. Hypocalcemia was corrected. Persistent low grade fever was noted while the infection biomarkers (CRP and procalcitonin) deteriorated. Targocid was added empirically on 8\/22 but generalized skin rash developed. Toxicoderma was suspected and Targocid was discontinued on 8\/23. However the BUN and creatinine level kept elevating while the delirium and drowsiness progressed. Renal replacement therapy was initiated with SLED on 8\/23 24 25 then TIW on Monday Wednesday and Friday. The consciousness soonly recovered after hemodialysis initiation. ID specialist was consulted for persistent ow grade fever and suspected occult infection. Tazocin was shifted to levofloxacin. Extubation was performed on 8\/26 smoothly. The urine output also increased and Burinex was titrated to keep dry weight 70kg. Under relatively stable condition the patient was transfered to general ward on 2021\/08\/28 for further management.","CC_CONTENT":"MED: Informant:patient and past medical records\nProgressive dyspnea with mild lower legs edema for one months.","PH_CONTENT":"MED: [Present history]\n This is a 65-year-old man with underlying disease of\n1.

Due to pneumonitis history lung function test was done smoothly on 2021\/8\/13 which showed mild obstructive pattern. Howerver he felt dyspnea with chest tightness at 2021\/8\/16 4:30 am. O2 3L was given and SpO2 could keep at 95-98%. Due to agitation with diaphoresis the patient could not lying down. Severe respiratory distress was noted with accessory muscle use. Therefore emergent endotracheal intubation was indicated. After discussing with the patient's wife she understood and agreed this situation. During sedation HR up to 150 bpm and hypertension with SBP>210 mmHg was noted. After the intubation ICU was called and the patient was transmitted to 3C-7-1 at 2021\/8\/16 7:40.\n\nAfter transferal on 8\/16 NTG pump was kept and anti-hypertensive agents were added sequentially for blood pressure control. Diuretics sodium bicarbonate and calcium supplement were titrated for chronic kidney disease. Cefepime was added for suspected occult infection. Flotrac was applied for hemodynamic monitoring. Bedside echo showed IVC diameter 1.7cm without collapsibility A profile over bilateral lung fields and no pleural effusion. CV specialist was consulted for HFrEF and acute decompensated heart failure who suggested adding vasodilators to decrease afterload. The blood pressure and the SVRI gradually decreased. NTG pump was discontinued on 8\/18. Concor was added on 8\/20.\n\nHowever an episode of breakthrough fever with transient hypotension and drowsiness developed on 8\/18. Urinanalysis revealed pyuria. Urinary tract infection was favored so Cefepime was shifted to Tazocin empirically for Enterococcus coverage. Also slow response and intermittent limb twitching were noted. Follow-up lab data also showed progressive azotemia elevating creatinine and hypocalcemia. Uremic encephalopathy was suspected. Nephrologist was consulted on 8\/19 who suggested medical treatment first. Hypocalcemia was corrected. Persistent low grade fever was noted while the infection biomarkers (CRP and procalcitonin) deteriorated. Targocid was added empirically on 8\/22 but generalized skin rash developed. Toxicoderma was suspected and Targocid was discontinued on 8\/23. However the BUN and creatinine level kept elevating while the delirium and drowsiness progressed. Renal replacement therapy was initiated with SLED on 8\/23 24 25 then TIW on Monday Wednesday and Friday. The consciousness soonly recovered after hemodialysis initiation. ID specialist was consulted for persistent low grade fever and suspected occult infection. Tazocin was shifted to levofloxacin. Extubation was performed on 8\/26 smoothly. The urine output also increased and Burinex was titrated to keep dry weight 70kg. Under relatively stable condition the patient was transfered to our ward on 2021\/08\/28 for further management.\n\nFollow-up CXR done on 8\/30 showed cardiomegaly with slightly infiltration over bilateral lung. The patient had no complaint of dyspnea or cough. Physical examination revealed clear breathing sound without crackles or wheezing. However low hemoglobin was noted on 8\/30 2U pRBC with Lasix were given on that day followed by increased urine output. Thus we started regular diuretics as a help for renal function recovery. Under stable fluid status thalium scan was done smoothly on 8\/31.

On 09\/26, a renal echo showed an infected cyst of the right kidney, and the patient was also consulted for suspect onychomycosis. By 09\/27, terbinafine and topical Loceryl were added for onychomycosis, and the patient reported improving erythema and pain over the left anterior shin. On 09\/28, an MRI of the left lower extremity showed suspect subcutaneous edema or cellulitis of the left leg, and on 09\/29, the patient's antibiotic was shifted from Tazocin to Cefepime due to a suspected drug rash and elevated eosinophil count. The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing pain and erythema, and the treatment plan includes continued antibiotics, oral hydration, and pending vascular duplex and further evaluation.","DEPT":"MED"}

The patient was also treated with antibiotics, including Ceftazidime and Vancomycin, for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. On 10\/27, the patient underwent TAVI with a 25mm Abbott\/SJM Portico transcatheter aortic heart valve, and a balloon valvuloplasty was performed to treat severe aortic regurgitation, resulting in residual moderate aortic regurgitation. Post-procedure, the patient was kept on BiPAP overnight and was closely monitored for respiratory and cardiac status.","DEPT":"MED"}

He presented to the emergency department with intermittent melena and yellow stool since late February 2023. Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) was diagnosed and he had received epinephrine injection on 2023\/2\/10 and argon plasma coagulation on 2023\/03\/02, 2023\/03\/09, 2023\/03\/17, and 2023\/08\/22. Besides, he also had the history of End-stage kidney disease an had been receiving Darbepoetin alfa injection, folic acid and vitamin B12 supplement for anemia. Pre-opd visit laboratory results on 2023\/10\/05 showed severe anemia with Hb 5.0 g\/dL. pRBC transfusion 2 U was given. Intermittent dark to black stool was also reported. The patient had general malaise and he denied exertional dyspnea or dizziness. Due to severe anemia, CKD with superimposed GI bleeding was impressed and he was then admitted for argon plasma coagulation for GAVE and anemia survey. After admission, he underwent IVG-EGD for argon plasma coagulation smoothly. The ammonia level and consciousness were improved after lactulose administration. Thus he was discharged on 10\/24. However, he suffered from altered mental status and hematemesis for one day. He complained decreased stool passage. Considering the risk of airway compromised, he was received intubaation for airway protection. As a result he is trasnferred to ICU for further management.\n\nFamily history: Father: colon cancer; sister: Type 1 DM \nMedication Allergy:No\nMedication ADR:unknown\nAllergy to Medical Device and Materials:No \nCurrent Medication:\n台大醫院:Esomelone for Inj 40 mg\/vial 40 mg STAT IV 1 days\nGlypressin 1 mg\/vial 1 mg STAT IV 1 days\n警 Humulin R 1000 U\/10 mL \/vial 20 U QD IF 2 days\n新 Tazocin (based on piperacillin content) 2000 mg\/vial 2000 mg STAT IF 1 days\nVitamin B1 inj 100 mg\/2 mL \/amp 100 mg STAT IV 1 days\nGlypressin 1 mg\/vial 1 mg Q6H IV 2 days\n警 Levophed 4 mg\/4 mL \/vial 8 mg QD cIF 2 days\n(管4) 2%警 Fresofol 2% MCT\/LCT 1000 mg\/50 mL \/vial 50 mg QD cIF 2 days\n60 Lactulose Liquid 600 mg\/1 mL 60 mL\/btl 30 mL STAT PO 1 days\n警 Relaxin 500 mg\/vial 不計價常備藥 75 mg STAT IV 1 days\nKatimin-1 (VIT.K1) 10 mg\/1 mL \/amp 10 mg STAT IM 1 days\n新 Tazocin (based on piperacillin content) 2000 mg\/vial 2000 mg Q8H IF 2 days\n新 Tazocin (based on piperacillin content) 2000 mg\/vial 2000 mg Q12H IF 2 days\nVitamin B1 inj 100 mg\/2 mL \/amp 100 mg Q12H IV 2 days\nEsomelone for Inj 40 mg\/vial 40 mg Q12H IV 2 days\nNexium 40 mg\/tab 1 tab QDAC1HR PO 28 days\nScrat Susp 1 g\/10 mL \/pack 1 pack QIDAC1HR PO 28 days\nMopride FC 5 mg\/tab 1 tab TID PO 28 days\nHARNALIDGE D 0.2 mg\/tab 2 tab QD LZ 28 days\nMidorine 2.5 mg\/tab 2 tab TIW PO 28 days\nFeburic 80 mg\/tab 0.5 tab QD PO 28 days\nTakepron OD 30 mg\/tab 1 tab QDAC LZ 28 days\nSennapur 12.5 mg\/tab 2 tab HS PO 28 days\n(管4) Xanax 0.5 mg\/tab 1 tab HSPRN PO 28 days\nZalain Cream 2% 15 g\/tube 1 XX BID D 28 days\nFolic Acid 5 mg\/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nFlexbumin 25% 12.5 g\/50 mL \/bag 12.5 g ONCE IF 1 days\nFlexbumin 25% 12.5 g\/50 mL \/bag 12.5 g ONCE IF 1 days\nB.C. \/cap 1 cap QD PO 28 days\nAllegra 60 mg\/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nLactulose (500 Lactulose Liquid 600 mg\/1 mL 500 mL\/btl) 30 mL QID PO 11 days\nCefuroxime Axetil (Ceflour 250 mg\/tab) 1 tab QN PO 11 days\n\nOther:\n中草藥:denied\n保健食品:denied\nPast Medical History: as above\nHospitalization:\n入院日期:2023_10_13 出院日期:2023_10_24 診斷:Liver cirrhosis\n入院日期:2023_08_23 出院日期:2023_09_22 診斷:Gastrointestinal bleeding\n入院日期:2023_06_14 出院日期:2023_07_21 診斷:Liver cirrhosis\n入院日期:2023_03_03 出院日期:2023_03_23 診斷:Gastrointestinal bleeding\n入院日期:2023_02_11 出院日期:2023_02_15 診斷:Gastric ulcer, acute\n入院日期:2022_07_03 出院日期:2022_07_26 診斷:Urinary tract infection, site not specified\n\nPast Surgical History:2023_07_07 RIJV Perm-cath implantation\n\n\n[Substance]\n-Alcohol:(0.5 standard drink* 25 years) \n-Betel nut:(-)\n-Cigarette:(+, 1PPD for 10 years, quitted for 10 years)","PT_CONTENT":"MED: *#.
