Hypertension\n\n  The patient had undergone heart transplantation on 2004/02/13. He received regular EMB for evaluation of rejection status and showed no cellular rejection. He was admitted in 2019/12 due to dyspnea and aggravated heart failure. Sick sinus syndrome was suspected and he received pacemaker implantation then.\n\n  According to his brother, general malaise, poor appetite, bilateral ankle swelling occurred for one week. Exertional dyspnea, oliguria, chest tightness was described for 2 days. Therefore, he was brought to our emergency department on 2022/02/21. On arrival, consciousness was clear E4V5M6. Vital signs were Blood Pressure: 135/103mmHg, Pulse Rate: 130/min, Respiratory Rate: 26/min, Temperature: 36℃, SPO2: 98%, with Simple mask 6L/min. Wheezing, abdominal distension, bilateral pitting edema were observed on physical examination. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, bilateral minimal pleural effusion. EKG was suspicious pacing rhythm. ADHF was impressed(rejection-induced?), so Rasitol was given. Superimposed community-acquired pneumonia from COPD AE could not be excluded, and empirical Unasyn, bronchodilator were prescribed. Under the impression of acute deocompensated heart failure, he was admitted to general ward 5A on 2022/02/21 for further evaluation and management.\n\n   After admission, KUB showed stool impaction without much bowel gas; therefore, stool softener, prokinetic were added. Recurrent hypoglycemia was shown, and D50W was injected.\n\nFamily History: no associated family history\nMedication Allergy: denied\nMedication ADR: denied\nAllergy to Medical Device and Materials: denied \nCurrent Medication:\n 台大醫院:\nRasitol Inj 20 mg/2 mL /amp 20 mg STAT IV 1 days\nAtrovent Neb Soln 250 mcg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp STAT IH 1 days\n警 Vitagen 50% 20 mL/amp 40 mL STAT IV 1 days\nBricanyl Neb Soln 2.5 mg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp STAT IH 1 days\n警 Vitagen 50% 20 mL/amp 80 mL STAT IV 1 days\n警 Vitagen 50% 20 mL/amp 40 mL STAT IV 1 days\nUnasyn (based on ampicillin content) 1000 mg/vial 1000 mg STAT IV 1 days\nRasitol Inj 20 mg/2 mL /amp 20 mg Q8H IV 2 days\nBricanyl Neb Soln 2.5 mg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp Q6H IH 2 days\nUnasyn (based on ampicillin content) 1000 mg/vial 1000 mg Q8H IV 2 days\nAtrovent Neb Soln 250 mcg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp Q6H IH 2 days\n1.25 Concor 1.25 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\n160 Diovan FC 160 mg/tab 1 tab BID PO 28 days\nSR Diltelan SR 120 mg/cap 1 cap BID PO 28 days\n75 Plavix 75 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nLipitor 20 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nEzetrol 10 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nLipanthyl Supra FC 160 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nAspirin 100 mg/tab 1 tab QDPC PO 28 days\nFeburic 80 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\nKascoal 40 mg/tab 1 tab TIDPC PO 28 days\nPredonine 5 mg/tab 0.5 tab QD PO 28 days\nAmaryl 2 mg/tab 2 tab QD PO 28 days\nLoditon 500 mg/tab 1 tab BIDPC PO 28 days\nQtern FC /tab 1 tab QAM PO 28 days\n25 Sandimmun Neoral 25 mg/cap 2 cap BID PO 28 days\nCellCept 250 mg/cap 6 cap BID PO 28 days\n Other: denied\n 中草藥: denied\n 保健食品: denied\nPast Medical History:\nHospitalization: 入院日期:2020_12_11 出院日期:2020_12_19 診斷:Heart transplant\n\nPast Surgical History:\n\nLifestyle:\nAlcohol consumption: binge drinking for 10+ years\nBetel nut chewing: denied\nCigarette smoking: 10 cigarettes per day for 20+ years\n\nTravel history: denied\nOccupation: unknown\nContact history: denied\nCluster histroy: denied", "PT_CONTENT": "SURG: 52y, male\n*\nS:\nProgressive dyspnea for 2 days\n\nO:\n[Vital sign]\nT: 35.7 °C, P: 68 bpm, R: 20 /min,\nBP: 160 / 115 mmHg,\nPain score: 0\n\n[PE]\n1.

He was regular followed up at family medicine OPD at 台大北護. Dating back his medical history, he initially noted abnormal CEA level (188) from the worker's health examination without any specific discomfort in 2018. He denied body weight loss, GI discomfort, constipation or diarrhea as initial presentation. \n\n For the recent 4 days he noticed no stool passage and abdominal fullness, and he also had nausea sensation. He came to family medicine OPD at 台大北護 and was referred to NTUH emergency department on 2022/5/11 under the impression of ileous. At triage, his vital signs remained relatively stable (Blood Pressure: 142/84mmHg, Pulse Rate: 70/min, Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 36.7℃, SPO2: 99％ ). Lab data showed hypokalemia and mild anemia. CT on 2022/5/11 revealed ileus with suspicious tumor recurrence over anastomosis site, proximal colon dilatation and distal retum collapsing, with left hydronephrosis. General surgeon was consulted. On 2022/5/14, he underwent cystoscope for left DBJ stent insertion but but the guidewire could not pass through left ureterovesical junction (UVJ), suspect left UVJ to lower ureter stricture and torsion related to post-op adhesion and recurrent tumor. He also received open surgery and revealed dilated small bowel loops and A-colon with small bowel adhesion and abdominal wall tumor via the right lower paramedian incision. Loop ileostomy was made. After the operation, the patient was admitted to our ward for postoperative care and management.\n\n\nFamily History: without known cancer history, hypertension, or diabetes family history\nMedication Allergy:No 病人自述 2022/5/15\nMedication ADR:unknown\nAllergy to Medical Device and Materials:unknown\nCurrent Medication:\n台大醫院:\n針 Primperan Inj 10 mg/2 mL /amp 10 mg Q8H IV 4 days\n(管4) 針 Tramal Inj 100 mg/2 mL /amp 100 mg STAT IF 1 days\nKCl in NS Inj 20 mEq/500 mL /btl (信東 0.298% KCl) 20 mEq STAT IF 1 days\nFlumarin 1000 mg/vial 1000 mg STAT IV 1 days\nEsomelone for Inj 40 mg/vial 40 mg STAT IV 1 days\nFlumarin 1000 mg/vial 1000 mg Q8H IV 2 days\nOther:\n中草藥: some chinese medicine for alternative treatment\n保健食品: denied\nPast Medical History: as mentioned above\nHospitalization: as mentioned aboved\n\nPast Surgical History:2022_05_14 cystoscopy\nTravel History: nil\nContact: Denied \nCluster: Denied", "PT_CONTENT": "SURG: *\n[S]\nNo stool passage for 4 weeks.
