Intermittent chest tightness since 2021/12","SURG: [Present illness]

This is a 61-year-old patient with underlying disease of 

- Coronary arterial disease, 3 vessel disease
- Left below knee peripheral arterial occlusive disease and left DM foot, s/p amputation left 1st/2nd toe
- Chronic left foot ulcer, 0.6cm
- Hypertension, under medication
- Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, under OHA and insulin
- Chronic kidney disease

This patient was regularly followed up at 雙和 Hospital for diabetes mellitus and hypertension for about 20 years. Left foot gangrene was found about 2 years ago. DM foot and PAOD was then diagnosed and left 1st/2nd toe amputation was performed at the same year. 

He developed intermittent chest pain since about 2021/12, and the pain would relieve spontaneously after resting. He denied exersional dypnea, claudication, palpitation and could still tolerate gentle exercise. He went to 北護 Dr. Tsai's OPD on 2022/01/14 for help. Vascular duplex on 2022/01/26 reported diffuse mild atherosclerosis, left below knee ATA no flow, PTA decreased blood flow. Compatiable with left below knee PAOD. Dipyridamole stress test on 2022/04/01 showed mixed ischemia with non-transmural scar at basal inferoseptal, apical lateral, mid to basal inferolateral, and mid to basal inferior walls. Catheterization was then arranged. 

He was admitted to CV ward on 2022/05/02. Coronary angiography on 2022/05/03 reported Coronary artery disease, 3-vessel-disease (LAD: ostial stenosis 70%, LCX: distal stenosis 90%, RCA: distal stenosis 90% and PDA stenosis 70%). After discharge, he was referred to CVS Dr. Chen's OPD for CABG evaluation on 2022/05/06. 

This time, he was admitted for CABG.

After PCN and changing of antibiotics, the patient's fever resolved, and the patient had good respiratory pattern. He was extubated on 11/8 successfully. Because of persistent DVT by echo, warfarin was resumed. Right middle and lower ureteral stricture was noted on 2021/11/16 during right ureteroscopy and right ureteral catheter insertion, which the guidewire but not the Fr. 4.5 ureteroscope was able to pass through. Right ESWL was arranged on 2021/11/23 and ureteral stone was partially
crushed. PCN clamping was attempted several times in 2021/11 but failed due to persistent hydronephrosis. This time, the patient was admitted for antegrade pyelopgraphy and balloon dilation of stricture. 

Upon admission this time, the patient reported no discomfort, attention, weight, appetite nor mobility changes since last discharge. There was nausea but no fever since last discharge. No flank pain was noted, and the PCN wound has no tenderness or redness. Bilateral lung base crackles was heard. The patient also noted slurred speech and occassional temporary word-finding difficulty. This patient received Right antegrade ureteral dilatation and DBJ insertion by radiologist on 2021/12/23.

The patient had no complaint of dyspnea or cough. Physical examination revealed clear breathing sound without crackles or wheezing. However low hemoglobin was noted on 8/30 2U pRBC with Lasix were given on that day followed by increased urine output. Thus we started regular diuretics as a help for renal function recovery. Under stable fluid status thalium scan was done smoothly on 8/31 and revealed probable mild stress-induced ischemia at mid anteroseptal apical lateral and apical inferior walls. Cardiologists were consulted. Owing to negative (treadmill ECG) and mildly positive (thallium scan) non-invasive testing coronary angiography is not advised. Evaluation of iron profile HIV screen serum protein EP ANA was carried out pending results. Also we added Dilatrend titrating gradually and tapering Doxaben adn Norvasc as suggested. Tenchoff catheter implantaton is scheduled on 9/08 for long term PD. During the meantime he ketp hemodialysis via double lumen smoothly.,"After transferal on 8/16 NTG pump was kept and anti-hypertensive agents were added sequentially for blood pressure control. Diuretics sodium bicarbonate and calcium supplement were titrated for chronic kidney disease. Cefepime was added for suspected occult infection. Flotrac was applied for hemodynamic monitoring. Bedside echo showed IVC diameter 1.7cm without collapsibility A profile over bilateral lung fields and no pleural effusion. CV specialist was consulted for HFrEF and acute decompensated heart failure who suggested adding vasodilators to decrease afterload. The blood pressure and the SVRI gradually decreased. NTG pump was discontinued on 8/18. Concor was added on 8/20.

However an episode of breakthrough fever with transient hypotension and drowsiness developed on 8/18. Urinanalysis revealed pyuria. Urinary tract infection was favored so Cefepime was shifted to Tazocin empirically for Enterococcus coverage. Also slow response and intermittent limb twitching were noted. Follow-up lab data also showed progressive azotemia elevating creatinine and hypocalcemia. Uremic encephalopathy was suspected. Nephrologist was consulted on 8/19 who suggested medical treatment first. Hypocalcemia was corrected. Persistent low grade fever was noted while the infection biomarkers (CRP and procalcitonin) deteriorated. Targocid was added empirically on 8/22 but generalized skin rash developed. Toxicoderma was suspected and Targocid was discontinued on 8/23. However the BUN and creatinine level kept elevating while the delirium and drowsiness progressed. Renal replacement therapy was initiated with SLED on 8/23 24 25 then TIW on Monday Wednesday and Friday. The consciousness soonly recovered after hemodialysis initiation. ID specialist was consulted for persistent ow grade fever and suspected occult infection. Tazocin was shifted to levofloxacin. Extubation was performed on 8/26 smoothly. The urine output also increased and Burinex was titrated to keep dry weight 70kg. Under relatively stable condition the patient was transfered to general ward on 2021/08/28 for further management.","MED: Informant:patient and past medical records

 He has proteinuria since 2016. In March 2018, he visited Dr. 黃政文's outpatient clinic due to impaired renal function was found (serum creatinine 1.7 and eGFR 43.6). Futher lab examination showed three plus positive of proteinuria, negative for serum P-ANCA and C-ANCA, as well as normal serum C3 and C4 levels. Renal biopsy on 2018/3/14 revealed membranous glomerulonephritis stage 1~2 , with mesangial matrix expansion. Endoxan and steroid pulse therapy was initiated since 2018/3/26. He had completed two course of the therapy of Endoxan on 2018/3/26 and 4/23. However, he had complained of dizziness and hyperglycemia after the third steroid pulse therapy on 2018/5/21. Further course was complicated with CMV pneumonitis and was hospitalized from 2018/7/24 to 2018/8/16. At that time, CMV viral load was 270 cp/mL in blood and 4270000 cp/mL in the sputum. He was treated with a complete course of Ganciclovir since 2018/7/30 to 8/13. Chest CT on 2018/7/27revealed pulmonary emphysema, CAT and mMRCA were 15 points and Grade 0~1 respectively. COPD GLOD A was suspected and pulmonary OPD follow up was suggested. After discharge, the patient was regularly follow up at Dr. 黃政文's outpatient clinic.

 His renal function still progressed gradually from stage 4 to stage 5 since March 2021. In recent three months, the patient came to our emergency department once a month due to dyspnea and heart failure signs. Elevated serum Pro-BNP level (4671) was also noted on 2021/06/25. He was referred to the cardiology OPD and 24 hour Holter text, transthoracic echocardiography(TEE) and dipyridamole test were arranged. On 2021/7/28, 24 hour Holter showed no long pause or obvious ST-T change. TTE on 2021/7/28 showed global LV hypokinesia with LVEF 27% and dilated LA and LV.
 This time, due to progressive dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxismal nocturnal dyspnea in recent one month, the patient was admitted for fluid status evaluation and dipyridamole test.

Upon transferring to 13D ward the patient denied specific discomforts. Vital sign was stable with no O2 demand. NG and Foley was kept from ICU. Double lumen was kept over right inguinal area with clean gauze covered. Physical examination revealed regular heart beat without obvious murmur no crackles or wheezing normoactive bowel sound no pitting edema. We will keep Cravit for 5-7 days if following lab data improving.

NG will be removed if oral intake was feasible. Foley catheter will be kept to monitor urine output. Further dialysis method needed to be discussed.

The patient was admitted with mild exertional dyspnea from OPD for scheduled thalium scan. Due to pneumonitis history lung function test was done smoothly on 2021/8/13 which showed mild obstructive pattern. Howerver he felt dyspnea with chest tightness at 2021/8/16 4:30 am. O2 3L was given and SpO2 could keep at 95-98%. Due to agitation with diaphoresis the patient could not lying down. Severe respiratory distress was noted with accessory muscle use. Therefore emergent endotracheal intubation was indicated. After discussing with the patient's wife she understood and agreed this situation. During sedation HR up to 150 bpm and hypertension with SBP>210 mmHg was noted. After the intubation ICU was called and the patient was transmitted to 3C-7-1 at 2021/8/16 7:40.

After transferal on 8/16 NTG pump was kept and anti-hypertensive agents were added sequentially for blood pressure control. Diuretics sodium bicarbonate and calcium supplement were titrated for chronic kidney disease. Cefepime was added for suspected occult infection. Flotrac was applied for hemodynamic monitoring. Bedside echo showed IVC diameter 1.7cm without collapsibility A profile over bilateral lung fields and no pleural effusion. CV specialist was consulted for HFrEF and acute decompensated heart failure who suggested adding vasodilators to decrease afterload. The blood pressure and the SVRI gradually decreased. NTG pump was discontinued on 8/18. Concor was added on 8/20.

However an episode of breakthrough fever with transient hypotension and drowsiness developed on 8/18. Urinanalysis revealed pyuria. Urinary tract infection was favored so Cefepime was shifted to Tazocin empirically for Enterococcus coverage. Also slow response and intermittent limb twitching were noted. Follow-up lab data also showed progressive azotemia elevating creatinine and hypocalcemia. Uremic encephalopathy was suspected. Nephrologist was consulted on 8/19 who suggested medical treatment first. Hypocalcemia was corrected. Persistent low grade fever was noted while the infection biomarkers (CRP and procalcitonin) deteriorated. Targocid was added empirically on 8/22 but generalized skin rash developed. Toxicoderma was suspected and Targocid was discontinued on 8/23. However the BUN and creatinine level kept elevating while the delirium and drowsiness progressed. Renal replacement therapy was initiated with SLED on 8/23 24 25 then TIW on Monday Wednesday and Friday. The consciousness soonly recovered after hemodialysis initiation. ID specialist was consulted for persistent low grade fever and suspected occult infection. Tazocin was shifted to levofloxacin. Extubation was performed on 8/26 smoothly. The urine output also increased and Burinex was titrated to keep dry weight 70kg. Under relatively stable condition the patient was transfered to our ward on 2021/08/28 for further management.

Follow-up CXR done on 8/30 showed cardiomegaly with slightly infiltration over bilateral lung. The patient had no complaint of dyspnea or cough. Physical examination revealed clear breathing sound without crackles or wheezing. However low hemoglobin was noted on 8/30 2U pRBC with Lasix were given on that day followed by increased urine output. Thus we started regular diuretics as a help for renal function recovery. Under stable fluid status thalium scan was done smoothly on 8/31. We are now pending the formal report.","2021-08-31

DIAGNOSIS: . ACKD, sepsis/hypertension crisis related, with azotemia 
. HFrEF (2021/07 EF 24%), etiology to be determined, with acute decompensation, superimposed with hypertension crisis related, s/p ETT + MV (2021/08/16-)
. Consciousness drowsiness, suspected sepsis, hypocalcemia, or sedative agents related
SUGGESTION: . Emergent HD was not indicated, consider gradually increased urea level; please treat sepsis, adjust sedative agents (morphine would be prolonged in excretion in CKD patients), and correct extremely low bioactive Ca level
. Please titrate burinex accordingly, and consult us for dialysis and heart support if refractory hypervolemia 
. Oral sodium bicarbonate, IV and oral form calcium carbonate (AC use)
. Treat sepsis and avoid nephrotoxic agents as your expertise
2021-09-02
MED
DIAGNOSIS: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, (LVEF: 26.9%), NYHA FC II, ACC/AHA stage C, sinus rhythm
SUGGESTION: -Diagnostic Plan-
1. Owing to negative (treadmill ECG) and mildly positive (thallium scan) non-invasive testing, coronary angiography is not advised. Suggest arranging CTCA (self-paid) for evaluation of coronary angiography if further evaluation of coronary is desired.
2. Please evaluate iron profile, HIV screen, serum protein EP, ANA.

-Therapeutic Plan-
1. Consider gradually transitioning Norvasc, Doxaben to higher doses of beta-blocker. If better control of blood pressure is desired, Dilatrend may be prescribed. 
2. If Diovan is well tolerated, consider switching to Entresto.
3. Please add spironolactone for HFrEF. May start from 25mg QD.
4. Iron supplement if transferritin saturation < 25% and/or ferritin < 150 ng/mL

DIAGNOSIS: 1. Tinea pedis et unguium, bilateral feet
2. PAOD with toe ulceration
SUGGESTION: 1. May consider PO itraconazole 2 cap QD for onychomycosis. (健保，12週，不連處)
  (**follow up liver function) (ESRD, under regular HD)
  (**beware of drug drug interaction)

  or/and Lomexin spray BID with nail filing every day after shower
  (若與口服藥併用則需自費)
  (若不使用口服藥: 健保一週一瓶)

2. Please inform the patient of the low response rate of topical antifungal for onychomycosis (< 20%), and the response rate of oral antifungal is approximately 60%.
  The effects of the oral antifungal may take 6-9 months to show.

3. Manage PAOD as your expertise.

# The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG, end-stage renal disease on regular hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hepatitis C, bradycardia with a permanent pacemaker, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
# The patient has undergone several vascular interventions including left SFA DCB angioplasty, left PTA, and peroneal artery plain balloon angioplasty, as well as procedures for right hydronephrosis and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
# The patient is also status post 25G pars plana vitrectomy, air-fluid exchange, endolaser, and intravitreal injection of silicone oil for the retinal detachment, and has pseudophakia in both eyes.
# The patient's current condition includes management of fever and soft tissue infection, alongside ongoing management of chronic conditions such as end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.","This week, the patient was treated for fever suspected to be related to left lower leg peripheral occlusive disease with soft tissue infection, and was initially on Tazocin starting on 09/20. On 09/26, a renal echo showed an infected cyst of the right kidney, and the patient was also consulted for suspect onychomycosis. By 09/27, terbinafine and topical Loceryl were added for onychomycosis, and the patient reported improving erythema and pain over the left anterior shin. On 09/28, an MRI of the left lower extremity showed suspect subcutaneous edema or cellulitis of the left leg, and on 09/29, the patient's antibiotic was shifted from Tazocin to Cefepime due to a suspected drug rash and elevated eosinophil count. The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing pain and erythema, and the treatment plan includes continued antibiotics, oral hydration, and pending vascular duplex and further evaluation.",MED

Cell block pathology later reported no evidence of malignancy. There was no malignant pleural effusion. Due to poor ECOG limited treatment options and advanced stage of cancer lung tumor biopsy was not arranged currently after discussion with family. High output ileostomy was noted despite regular Imolex use. Biofermin was added. Foley catheter was removed. Sputum amount then gradually increased. Follow-up CXR showed right lower lung consolidation. Fever then developed. Sputum culture yielded KP and CR Pseudomonas. After discussion with ID specialist IH colistin was added due to poor renal function. Ertapenem was kept.

  He was regularly followed by VS.賴碩倫 for colon cancer, which was treated with surgery in 2019 and complicated with several infection episode in the past two years. His ADL and iADL were totally dependent (bedridden for 2 years and lived in a nursing home; 家屬說平時不講話，但狀況好的時候可講單詞且會認人，管灌+全靜脈營養支持).

  This time, he was noted sputum and cough for weeks (almost for a month), which was treated with oral antibiotic (clindamycin). However, the cough persisted and fever was noticed 10 days before this admission (2022/02/18). He was brough to NTUH ER for help 4 days before this admission. At triage, he was noticed stupor (E4V2M4), tachycardia (TPR 36.6/122/30, BP 117/70, SpO2 0.95), coarse breathing sound and dependent part pitting edema. CT revealed 1. bilateral lung metastasis, 2. bilateral lower consolidation, 3. left empyema, 4. pneumobilia in the left intrahepatic ducts, and common bile duct stones. Chest tube was inserted for left emyema (2022/02/25), which was also treated with strong antibiotic (adjusting; meropenem and teicoplanin finally). Moreover, progressing dyspnea (even under non-rebreathing mask) and profound shock (norepinephrime 8/250 mg/ml, rate 30 ml/hr) were noted hours before this admission, he received intubation and mechanical ventilator support. As for type 1+4 respiratory failure (pneumonia and empyema related), he was admitted to MICU for further management.

 - keep meropenem (02/27-) and teicoplanin (02/24-)
 - pursue culture
 - follow infection profile and CXR periodically

#. Respiratory failure (T1+4RF)
 - keep ETT+MV
 - down-titrate if possible
 - adjust fluid status (dry lung if possible)
 - remove pleural effusion if needed

#. Hemodynamic status
 - keep NE +/- VP as indicated
 - keep stress steroid with prophylactic PPI
 - keep vitamin B1
 - check PPV and CVP
 - monitor ABP and LA closely

#. Acute kidney injury, KDIGO stage I
 - correct systemic perfusion first
 - avoid nephrotoxic agents
 - monitor UOP, fluid status and uremic symptoms

[會談摘要]
會談對象：病次子
1. 院內目前因應中央covid19防疫政策限制探病，電聯病次子，會談中評估病家後續醫療意向為緩和醫療，希望病人順順的，但不知如何將此概念放入醫療處置中，在選擇醫療處置時需醫護人員多加說明處置角色與目的，經討論與說明後病子理解氣切手術對病人此階段的主要目的為清除痰液，未來若病人因病情進展至呼吸衰竭，就不使用呼吸器維生。

2. 說明安寧共同照護、病房及居家團隊照護內涵與銜接方式，未來可視病情及照護需求再做銜接。病子提問出院後至護理之家照護如何得到緩和醫療照護?予以說明現況及可與護理之家溝通的部分，病子可理解。

3. 病次子表示哥哥已表達不會參與討論也不會參與照顧，故後續會以病大姊及次子為病人主要照顧及溝通窗口。

[後續照護計畫]
1. 協助病家調適與因應後續照護，提供心理支持。
2. 若有安寧療護問題，可聯繫安寧共照小組，分機72293/GSM 53477.

DIAGNOSIS: . Primary hyperthyroidism, presented with T4 thyrotoxicosis, suspect toxic adenoma or subacute thyroiditis, superimposed with euthyroid sick syndrome
. Hypercalcemia, etiology to be determined, r/o primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy-related hypercalcemia
. Elevation of iPTH, multiple causes, considering secondary to underlying CKD, vitamin D deficiency, denosumab-induced compensatory response and/or true primary hyperparathyroidism
. Others: Colon cancer with bil lung mets; CKD (3b)
SUGGESTION: [Recommendations]
1. For primary hyperthyroidism:
  (1) Initiate anti-thyroid treatment with propylthiouracil 50 mg/day
     - Watch for adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis, hepatic dysfunction and allergic reaction 
     - Follow CBC/DC and complete liver tests regularly
  (2) Arrange thyroid echo after condition turns stable and transfer to the setting of ordinary ward
  (3) Follow thyroid function regularly

2. For hypercalcemia, improved:
  (1) Recheck Ca/P/Cl/iPTH/Alb/ALP/LDH simultaneously when next time blood sampling
  (2) Consider investigations on the status of malignancy for possible hypercalcemia etiology surveys(eg. osteolytic lesions caused by bone metastases)

# Patient experienced profound shock suspected to be sepsis-related, managed with levophed and pitressin.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease developed, with creatinine levels increasing from 2.3 to 4.8.
# Hypertension, enlarged prostate with lower urinary tract symptoms, and left inguinal hernia status post repair in 2019 are ongoing underlying conditions.
# The patient underwent a significant surgical procedure and is being closely monitored for post-operative complications and response to treatment.","This week, the patient underwent transperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy on 03/15. Post-operatively, the patient experienced profound shock, suspected to be sepsis-related, and was managed with levophed and pitressin. On 03/19, CVVH was initiated due to oliguria, and the patient was kept on levophed and pitressin due to unstable blood pressure. By 03/20, the patient's condition had led to a suspicion of leakage, with amylase and lipase levels of 2666U/L and 123U/L, respectively, in the fluid drained from the surgical site, prompting the discontinuation of enteral nutrition. On 03/21, a significant increase in CWV drain output was noted, with 700mL drained within 20 minutes, and an A+P CT scan revealed a hematoma in the pancreatic tail area. On 03/22, PTCD was performed for left upper quadrant fluid collection and peri-pancreatic tail area drainage. The patient's ventilator settings were gradually tapered, and by 03/25, the patient was on PC/SIMV with an FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 6. Throughout the week, the patient's hemodynamic status, infection control, and CVVH were closely monitored, with adjustments made as necessary to manage the patient's complex post-operative course.",URO

Aggravated auditory hallucination for 1 month and asking for admission.
經門診治療，反應仍不盡理想者。","PSYC: The 29-year-old man was extroverted in nature. He had poor academic performance in school and graduated from 強恕高中 at age 21(原先念高職，中斷兩年後再去念高中).

At age 15, he claimed to have intermittent AH of the sound of his friends(聽到朋友聲音竊竊私語說他是報馬仔，在沒人的空房間也會聽到說話聲). Delusion of being followed and persecutory delusion were also noted under AH. The symptoms would occurr occassionaly from age 15-21. He didn't seek medical help, neither did he take medication. At age 21(late 2013), he started to serve in the military with fair performance. Howerver, in 2014/1, after a conversation with his colleage, he was presented with persecutory delusion(對方自稱是有混過道上，處理過很多事，從此之後開始會害怕對方，怕對方會捅他、殺他). Anxiety and interpersonal avoidance occurred(會因此不敢接觸對方，整天一直擔心會被他捅) with conversing AH (會聽到三個男人的聲音，要拿刀捅他，也會聽到腳步聲). Suicidal ideation then developed and he jumped from second floor impulsively at age 22(2014/1). He strained his ankle and was sent to 陽明大學附設醫院. Under his father's request, he was transferred to our ER for help and was then admitted to 3W2. Brain CT was insignificant. His psychotic symptoms gradually improved under Risperdal 3mg/d. He was then discharged after 2 weeks and was referred to 北投國軍醫院 for 驗退鑑定. Psychotic disorder was told but he did not return to OPD or take medication due to limited insight. In 2014/2, he started working in his father's 廣告公司. His condition and working performance were stable for 3 years(age 22-24) with only intermittent AH of the sound of footstep and 悉窸窣窣聲(幾天出現一次，每次幾分鐘) through the years without interference in his mood and daily life.

However, at age 24(late 2016), the frequency of the AH increased and initial insomnia under the influence of AH was noted, along with anxious and mildly irritable mood. He could complete his job but would feel sleepy in daytime due to poor sleep quality. He developed aggravated AH and delusion of being followed in 2017/2, with fearful mood(refused to go home). He was brought to our ED and was bridged to Dr.林奕廷's clinics. Invega 3mg and later 6mg was given. He had poor compliance(覺得不舒服才吃). He developed delusional perception at age 25(2017/4)(覺得哥哥長得像叔叔，一定是叔叔非禮媽媽生下來的). He took a knife and attacked his uncle. He was arrested and had been imprisoned in 台北看守所 since then under unknown dosage of unknown antipsychotics. Forensic psychiatric assessment was performed in 2017/10 and he was suggested to be given long-term antipsychotics treatment. After negotiating with the judge, his family brought him to our hospital and he was hospitalized.

During last hospitalization in 2018/2-4, Latuda 20mg given in 台北看守所 was resumed. However, acute dystonia(嘴巴張開無法閉上) was noted on the same night. After reviewing previous psychiatric medication history, Invega was initiated as he had good response to Risperdal. There were no positive symptoms under treatment. Due to previous non-complaince and associated violent behaviors, Invega Sustenna 150mg was given. Another acute dystonia episode was noted, which subsided under anti-cholinergics.

After last admission, he received follow-ups at Dr.謝明憲's OPD regularly. He received monthly 100mg Invega Sustenna injection from 2018/04-2018/09. Under the patient and his family's preference of oral medication over injection(打針100mg改為150mg之後非常嗜睡，難以工作，爸爸及個案均要求嘗試口服), Abilify were added since 2018/7 from 2.5mg/d and remained at 5mg/d from 2018/8-2019/03. In 2018/10, Invega injection was switched to oral tablets and remained at 9mg/d from 2018/10-2019/4. Since 2019/4, Invega was discontinued, and Abilify was increased gradually to 30mg/d since 2019/3. For augmentation, during 2020/9-2021/4, Solian 400mg/d was used, and since 2021/4, Binin 10-15mg/d was used.

His current medication included Abilify 30mg/d and Binin 15mg/d. Medication compliance was fair(每月保護管束保護官會檢查服藥紀錄). There was residual symptom of intermittent AH(內心有人在跟自己對話，討論各種主題), without psychotic symptoms including delusion, disorganized speech or behavior, or visual hallucination. There were times when AH flared up, and medication was increased in dose. Symptoms could be generally controlled. He could work in his family's company(廣告監工) from 12 to 8PM. His interpersonal relationship was stable without conflicts. There was weight gain of 20kg in 4 years.

Since a month ago, AH increased in frequency and duration(從每週2次，每次10多分鐘到現在每天1次，每次3-4hr). Content was same as before(窸窸窣窣聲音，內心有人在跟自己對話，自己的聲音不是自己想表達的意思，會有侯友宜和朋友跟自己談事情等). AH appeared mostly before sleep, and had affected his sleep and emotion. He had poor sleep initiation with shallow sleep, and needed Imovane 2#. There was increased irritability when AH appeared, sometimes with violent ideation(煩到想要打人). Overvalue ideation of being monitored was noted but no other psychotic symptoms, or evidence of a mood episode. He denied recent psychosocial stressors. Smoking remained stationary with 1PPD for 16 years.

He reported increased alcohol use since 2021/7, with tolerance(從每週2次到現在幾乎每天喝，2-3 shots to 1/2 bottle of Whiskey), withdrawal symptoms, and craving. AH seemed to appear more often under alcohol use. He reported he quit alcohol since 2022/2/12 and mild tremor, skin itchness, nausea/vomiting(last for a month) and restless developed. On 2/17, he visited ER due to aggravated AH and asked for admission. He was referred to OPD on 2/18 and was put on waiting list. However, he came to ER again on 2/19 due to same reasons. There was no significant change in intensity, frequency and content of his AH and he denied related suicide/homicide ideations.

白班入院護理過程紀錄摘要/n病人於11:45由急診傳送人員陪同下單手約束推床入病房，外觀衣著整潔合宜，態度和善客氣，可配合簽署入院相關同意書及安檢。依據電子病歷及病人自述，病前人格外向活潑，21歲時畢業於強恕高中(原先念高職，中斷兩年後再去念高中)；從15歲時始出現幻聽說自己是報馬仔，在沒人的空房間也會聽到說話聲，也有被跟蹤感，尚不影響睡眠和情緒，故未就醫，但在2014年當兵時因環境適應問題開始出現幻聽（會聽到三個男人的聲音，要拿刀捅他，也會聽到腳步聲)，迫害妄想（同事自稱是有混過道上，處理過很多事，從此之後開始會害怕對方，怕對方會捅他，殺他)，曾從二樓跳下導致左踝關節骨折，現活動正常，於2014/1時住過本病房經藥物治療後二週轉至北投國軍醫院進行驗退鑑定，回父親的廣告公司工作，病情和工作表現穩定，出院後自行停藥，2017年開始陸續會出現幻聽(間歇性的腳步聲和悉窸窣窣聲的聲音)，幻聽頻率增加導致失眠，焦慮度提升，在家把自己鎖在房間，當時在林奕廷醫師門診治療，2017/4跟叔叔起口角衝突(覺得哥哥長得像叔叔，一定是叔叔非禮媽媽生下來的)，砍傷叔叔，家人報警處理，被捕後關押台北看守所，陸續在台大醫院做精神鑑定，在獄中可配合服藥，而上次住院為2018/2/13-4/2，因配合法院協商安置問題，轉至本院持續觀察症狀、穩定後規則在謝明憲醫師門診就診。自述藥物由媽媽控管，規則服藥及就診，每月保護管束保護官也會檢查服藥紀錄，但病人仍有間歇性幻聽(內心有人在跟自己討論，主題討論)，仍可於中午12點到晚上8點在自家公司做廣告監工的工作。而此次為病人第三次住院，表示近一個月前開始，幻聽的頻率及持續時間都有增加(從每週二次，現在每次十多分鐘到每天一次，每次3-4小時)，內容和過去相仿(內心有人在跟自己對話、自己的聲音不是自己想表達的意思、有侯友宜和朋友跟自己談事情等)，而於幻聽出現時，偶煩躁到想打人，夜眠品質差、淺眠，自認近期無明顯壓力源或人際困擾。自述自己每日抽菸10支，菸齡16年，而酒齡3年，從2021/7以來，飲酒量增加，從每週二次、到幾乎每天喝一次三小杯至半瓶威士忌，出現戒斷症狀後，自述從2/12戒酒，出現輕度震顫、皮膚搔癢、噁心嘔吐和煩躁不安感，於2/17幻聽情形加劇，入急診要求住院，於2/18入門診候床名單，於2/19因幻聽又再次入急診，於急診給予過Anxicam 1amp及Haldol 1amp IM STAT，自覺注射後針劑狀況未改善，但觀察情緒穩定，現無自殺或傷人想法，經急診精神科照會醫師評估入院調藥治療。午伙全吃完，可配合服藥，個人衛生可自理，偶於公共空間活動，班內無自殺、自傷、暴力及逃跑等情形，續觀情緒及精神症狀變化。

白班護理過程紀錄/n病人班內生命徵象穩定，情緒尚穩，飲食正常，可吃完早午院伙。主訴睡眠斷斷續續，晚上幻聽狀況最為明顯，心中有一股不是自己的聲音在講話，使他的睡眠受到干擾。會主動與其他病友互動，如：詢問其他病友吃飽了沒、要不要一起打桌球等。今OT時間參與感低，表示對塗色及圈選成語較無興趣，只塗了2個英文字母，成語圈選游戲則完全沒做便放棄，自述較無耐心所以不想繼續畫，便開始閉目養神，態度顯得拒絕。主訴尼古丁咀嚼錠可緩解菸癮，可使自己較無煩躁感，但尼古丁戒斷症狀明顯，會比較坐立難安，四處走動，也會不到一小時就索取口嚼錠(病人表示戒菸貼片效果差)；主動找主治謝醫師表示希望能將口服藥物改成針劑，比較方便，但希望不藥有以前的副作用，經醫師講解目前是有較新型的長效針劑，病人表示很能接受，但醫師提醒住院期間可能無法將所有口服藥物都改成針劑，針劑搭配口服藥物，應該是必要的安排，病人口頭表示可接受。ADL可自理，外觀乾淨無異味，班內無自殺、自傷、暴力及逃跑等情形，續觀情緒及精神狀況變化。SN李恩羽

結論:
病人幻聽干擾明顯，觀察症狀及考慮調整藥物。

未來出院規劃:

因病人缺乏病識感，加上服藥遵從性差，父母年邁，病人殘餘精神症狀會影響家人生活，與家人常起衝突，且工作受到影響，醫療團隊積極提供出院準備服務，建議未來施打長效針，給予藥物衛教，讓病人出院後繼續獲得良好的治療及照護。

白班護理過程紀錄/n病人班內生命徵象穩定，情緒尚穩，飲食正常，可吃完早午院伙。主訴昨天打了長效針後晚上幻聽狀況有明顯改善，已無瑣碎聲音干擾，但睡眠仍斷斷續續，病人認為可能是因為認床的關係，表示自己習慣睡雙人床，所以病房的單人床讓他睡得不舒服，且棉被只有兩條會覺得有點冷。右手臂之長效針施打部位有約3x3cm腫起，主訴有疼痛感，已予冰袋冰敷，持續觀察施打部位變化。額頭左側靠近頭髮處有一約1x2cm乾癬，可自行塗抹外用藥膏；臀部乾癬處則拒絕塗藥，覺得即使塗了也沒有效果，臀部藥膏班內先暫停使用一次。早操過程中態度較不積極，動作隨意，並欲中途離場，經勸說後可返回隊伍，但仍無做出完整早操動作。OT時間參與度可，健走時可與護生及其他病友互動聊天、態度佳，但走到一半就表示走夠了，便返至護理站外坐著休息。隨後與其他病友一起玩撲克牌，玩一場後覺得無聊便離場，經再次邀約後可返至遊戲室繼續玩牌，但仍需多鼓勵才能持續參加，顯得持續力較差。今會談過程中病人詢問護生與前天（2/22）同樣的問題，如:「高中讀哪裏、是什麼大學、怎麼升學、以後要去哪個單位上班等」，護生給予與前天同樣的回答後，病人仍無意識到自己前天也問過一樣的問題、得到過一樣的答案。今主動提及出院後第一件要做的事情是剪頭髮，剪完後再去行天宮拜拜、收驚，讓出院後生活過得順一些。言談中病識感仍低，認為只是來調藥，疾病沒有復發。下午報名參加病房歌唱活動，選唱""差一點""，過程態度積極，參與度高，可配合活動進行，也能有耐心等待自己的號次。ADL可自理，外觀乾淨無異味，班內無自殺、自傷、暴力及逃跑等情形，續觀情緒及精神狀況變化。/SN李恩羽

 The patient had been ADL-dependent since 2022/06 after being diagnosed as stage 4 cecal adenocarcinoma. Initially, decreased appetite, abdominal fullness and gradual body weight loss were noted in the past 2 years. The above symptoms worsened in 2022/05 that he barely ate anything and complained abdominal pain and constipation. He then visited our ER and was admitted to our hospital for further survey. CT scan on 2022/5/26 showed cecal cancer with paracaval lymphadenopathy and small bowel ileus, tentative staging cT3N1M1a. Colonoscopy with tumor biopsy was performed on 2022/06/06 and the pathology revealed adenocarcinoma. General surgeon was thus consulted. After discussion with the patient and his family, they preferred palliative care and the patient received ileostomy on 6/10. He was then discharged with OPD follow-up.

 However, after discharge, poor appetite, general malaise were still noted. He needed assistance for eating, bathing, self-hygeine and was mostly bedridden. He was thus brought to our emergency department in 2022/07 for evaluation and anorexia-related prerenal acute kidney injury was impressed. His condition improved after adequate hydration and foley catheter was inserted for recording urine output. Poor oral intake with fair urine output was noted during the past one month. But, lower abdominal pain, decreased urine output and drowsy consciousness were noted on 8/11 noon when his daughter visited him. There was no fever, chills, dyspnea, flank pain, constipation, or tarry/bloody stool. Intermittent productive cough with thick whitish sputum was noted. He was thus brought to our ED on 2022/8/12 for further management.

 At triage, vital signs were as following: Blood Pressure: 107/74mmHg, Pulse Rate: 71/min,
Respiratory Rate: 16/min, Temperature: 36.7'C, SpO2: 97%. Physical examination showed soft abdomen without tenderness, intact cranial nerves, and muscle power all 5. Lab data showed leukocytosis with left shift (WBC 11.59k, Seg 88.4%), elevated CRP level (1.49), lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury (Cr 2.7, BUN 59.4), and pyuria. KUB showed increased bowel gas with dilatation of bowel loops in the abdomen, r/o ileus. Bedside echo showed IVC kissing sign positive, no hydronephrosis, and ileus. Empirical Tazocin and IV fluid hydration were thus administered for urinary tract infection (UTI) and acute on chronic kidney disease (ACKD). Prokinetic was given for suspect ileus. Further C+A+P CT scan was arranged for infection focus survey and showed cecal cancer with mild dilatation of distal ileum; and mild fibrotic change at both lungs, some faint patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) at RUL, also r/o mild fibrotic change. Urine culture on 8/12 yielded ESBL E.coli >100000 and wild type K.pneumonia 50000, while sputum culture on 8/12 yielded wild type K.pneumonia 1+ and oxacillin-sensitive S.aureus 3+. Tazocin was thus shifted to Cravit for better coverage. During ER stay, his conscious became clear and his urine output gradually increased. Lab data showed improved leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, electrolye imbalance, and acute kidney injury.

 This time, under the impression of UTI and ACKD, he was admitted to our ward on 2022/8/17 for further management.

On 08/18, Invanz was started for ESBL E.coli UTI, and the patient's urine output gradually increased. By 08/19, the patient's oral intake had mildly increased, and abdominal pain had resolved. Laboratory results on 08/18 showed improved leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance, with a urine analysis revealing pyuria and yeast. A chest X-ray on 08/18 showed ill-defined opacities at the right apical lung field, prompting consideration of acid-fast stain. The patient's depressed mood was addressed with the addition of Brintellix 0.5# QN on 08/18. Overall, the patient's condition has stabilized, with ongoing management of UTI, ACKD, and cecal adenocarcinoma.",FM

This patient received regular hemodialysis at our hospital for several years. She complained about dyspnea and chest tightness on the midnight on 2023/10/12 while lying down on her bed. She was then sent to our ER immediately. At triage, vital signs were: Blood Pressure: 177/98mmHg, Pulse Rate: 122/min, Respiratory Rate: 24/min, Temperature: 36.5℃, SPO2: 97％. EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, nonspecific ST and T wave abnormality. Under the impression of coronary artery disease, cardiac enzyme was check, which revealed 113.1 and 110.7 ng/L. Lab data showed no leukocytosis(WBC 8.94K/μL), mild anemia(HB 10.8 g/dL), no CO2 retention(pCO2 46.6 mmHg). Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and increased infiltrations in both lung fields. Due the pneumonia and pulmonary edema cannot be ruled out in emergency room, Ceftriaxone and nitroglycerin were added. 

This time, she was admitted to our ward for further evaluation and management.

The patient had been regularly followed up at Nephrologist Dr.賴台軒 and GI specialist Dr. 蘇東弘. He presented to the emergency department with intermittent melena and yellow stool since late February 2023. Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) was diagnosed and he had received epinephrine injection on 2023/2/10 and argon plasma coagulation on 2023/03/02, 2023/03/09, 2023/03/17, and 2023/08/22. Besides, he also had the history of End-stage kidney disease an had been receiving Darbepoetin alfa injection, folic acid and vitamin B12 supplement for anemia. Pre-opd visit laboratory results on 2023/10/05 showed severe anemia with Hb 5.0 g/dL. pRBC transfusion 2 U was given. Intermittent dark to black stool was also reported. The patient had general malaise and he denied exertional dyspnea or dizziness. Due to severe anemia, CKD with superimposed GI bleeding was impressed and he was then admitted for argon plasma coagulation for GAVE and anemia survey. After admission, he underwent IVG-EGD for argon plasma coagulation smoothly. The ammonia level and consciousness were improved after lactulose administration. Thus he was discharged on 10/24. However, he suffered from altered mental status and hematemesis for one day. He complained decreased stool passage. Considering the risk of airway compromised, he was received intubaation for airway protection. As a result he is trasnferred to ICU for further management.

DIAGNOSIS: # Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, suspect GAVE related
SUGGESTION: 1. EGD will be scheduled on 10/30 all day on call
-  I had explained the indication and potential complications of this procedure, such as aspiration, perforation, rebleeding and infection to the patient and family. Please help to finish the permit and put-of-pocket permit before the procedure. (已當面解釋過檢查適應症和風險，請於檢查前協助病患簽署電子同意書及紙本自費同意書 - 紅單) 
- The patient MUST be accompanied by the family (一定要有家屬陪同)
- Keep Hb > 7 g/dL, PLT > 80 k/ul, INR < 1.5, fibrinogen > 150
******* Please correct coagulopathy first, we will perform EGD once the coagulopathy is corrected
- Keep NPO with IVF supplement
2. Please keep high dose PPI and NPO if suspicious of UGIB
3. If peptic ulcer bleeding after endoscopic hemostasis, high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy is recommended continuously or intermittently for 3 days, followed by twice-daily oral proton pump inhibitor for the first 2 weeks of therapy after endoscopy. 
4. Repeat endoscopy is suggested if recurrent bleeding
5. If an unstable hemodynamic condition was noted due to bleeding, suggest consulting a radiologist for TAE and consult a general surgeon for surgical intervention.


Thank you for your consultation.

#. Probable invasive aspergillosis in 2021",2023-12-15 09:17:00,During this week a breakthrough fever to 39.6 celsius degress developed on 12/11. Empirical Tazocin was given and septic workup was performed. However another episode of desaturation developed on 12/13 morning. Massive bloody content was drained from the NG tube and a lot of blood-tinged sputum was suctioned from the nasal cavity. To exclude UGIB or hemoptysis whole body CT was performed on 12/13. No active bleeder was noticed. Persistent right sinusitis and otomastoiditis were found. Another episode of hypotension developed on 12/14 morning. Inotropes with levoped was temporarily administered. Septic shock or hypovolemic shock were suspected. Fluid resuscitation was given and empirical antibiotics were upgraded to Meropenem and Teicoplanin. After thorough discussion with ID specialist and his family they agreed to sent sputum sample for self-financed NGS analysis on 12/15.,During this week his fever did not subside. Cravit was shifted to Minocycline (12/01-) due to sputum culture yielded Stenotrophomonas maltophilia which was resistant to Cravit. Whole body CT was performed on 12/01 and revealed an enlarged (8mm) subpleural nodular opacity at left upper lobe and peribronchial patchy opacities at bilateral lower lobes which was compatible with pneumonia. COVID antigen rapid test still showed positive results. The latest PCR Ct level was 25.9. We contact ID specialist for further managment. After explaining the current status of poor viral shedding and benefits and risks of further treatment second course of Remdesevir combined with cased Paxlovid was initiated since 12/06. As for his digestion oral feeding was resumed since 12/05 and no coffee ground content was found from NG tube. However his digestion was still poor and could tolerate only 300ml milk/day.,"MED: Informant:Patient's mom and past medical record

Bilateral hands tremors followed by a fall accident last night","MED: This 46-year-old man with underlying history of:
1. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal, stage I, 
- status post LOD (III, 2018/11/28-2019/01/25), 
- status post local radiotherapy (2019/03/20-2019/04/26); complete remission (2019/08 PET), with relapse (2019/11/28), 
- status post ESHAP (III, 2019/12/27-2020/03/02), 
- status post auto-peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto=PBSCT, 2020/04/20), relapse (2021/04/16), 
- status post weekly Pralatrexate (2021/06/12, 06/19), 
- status post self-paid pembrolizumab (II, 2021/07/24, 08/16) plus weekly Pralatrexate (07/19, 07/26, 08/03, 08/16, 08/23, 08/30), complete remission, 
- status post reduced intensity conditioning, then allo-PBSCT (2021/11/20), trilineage engraftment and full donor chimerism, relapse (2022/01/17 PET: new para-caval node), 
- status post Nivolumab (20mg, 2022/01/25) to induce Graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, 

2. Extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD; skin, joint, liver, mouth), with progressive scleroderma (2023/01), status post Rituximab (C1D1=2023/02/08, C2D1=2023/04/04), on Jakavi(2023/07/02-).


The patient was recently discharged for an unknown fever on 2023/10/24 but experienced a mild fever, productive cough, malaise, and poor appetite for severeal days. A positive COVID-19 home rapid test and NMV/r was prescribed at outpatient clinic. Due to poor activity and malaise, the patient was admitted to NTUCC ER for COVID-19 management. He was isolated and kept on NMV/r treatment, followed by Remdesivir(11/07~11/10) for immunocompromised status. Prophylactic Baktar and Prednisolone were administered. Intermittent oxygen was supplied for hypoxemia, and Acetal was added for fever. Ceftriaxone and later Mycamin were given due to blood culture revealing yeast-like growth. Port-A catheter was removed on 11/07. Epistaxis and anemia were treated with component therapy. Cefepime, followed by oral Cravit were prescribed for persistent fever. Hypovolemic shock and mild AKI were treated with medical treatment, and PPN was administered for poor appetite, as well as oral Megest. On 11/09, the patient experienced weakness, nausea, and progressive bilateral hand tremors. According to his mother as the bedside caregiver, he complained much nausea feeling that vertigo, deviated gait, or asymetric muscle weakness was not noted. Slurred speech was as his baseline. He had a fall accident with uncertainess of head injury later when he attempted to walk to the toilet and vomited a lot. Conscious disturbance was unsure as no witness was present then. Computed tomography of head revealed intracranial hemorrhage and various inflammatory processes. the patient was transferred to the ICU. Efforts to manage coagulopathy, control blood pressure, and assess consciousness were made. The patient's condition worsened, and a repeat brain CT showed no improvement. He was then transferred to NTUH for further evaluation of surgical intervention needs.

[Present Illness]
This is a 3-year-3-month-old boy with no known systemic disease. He had just completed a 2 week antibiotics course for acute otitis media last month. He received this year's annual flu shot on 2023/10/04. Fever developed on 2023/10/05 morning. Associated symptoms included cough, stuffy nose and yellowish nasal discharge. He was brought to local medical doctor and flu shot related reaction was impressed. However fever persisted; thus he was brought to local medical clinic again and received a 4 days course of antibiotics treatment. Fever up to 39 degrees developed on 2023/10/07 and eardrum erythemata with injected throat were reported during their visit again to clinic on 10/09. For persisted symptoms, he was brought to our emergency department on 2023/10/10. At our ER, his parents reported symptoms of vomiting after food ingestion, and significantly decreased oral intake. Laboratory result showed leukocytosis, and also positive result for influenza B virus. For further management, the patient was admitted to our ward on 2023/10/10.","PED: *

Progressive dizziness and headache for 2 months followed by drowsines for 1 week","MED: This was a 61 year-old woman without known systemic diseases. She was ADL/iADL independent at baseline. 

She had suffered from dizziness with generalized headache since 2 months ago. Neck stiffness, chest and back dullness pain was also noted. However, there was no fever, no vertigo, no nausea or vomiting, no focal weakness or numbness and no urinary incontinence. She search help from Chinese medicine and received massage with partial improvements. Gradually, she became drowsy, her appetite decreased, and her gait became unsteady. She had weight loss of 7 kg (~12%) this month, and she mostly lied on the bed due to general malaise. Her speech became confused and disoriented about 1 week ago, and she refused any oral intake. She was initially brought to the 台北長庚 ER, where the exams were unremarkable, and she was discharged. This time she was brought to our ER 2 days ago. 

At triage, mild tachycardia (HR of 125/min) with stable hemodynamics and mild desaturation (SpO2 94% in ambient air) improved under nasal cannula was noted. Her muscle power was at least 3+ in both upper limbs, but she could not obey orders. Cranial nerve function was normal. Her blood tests revealed leukocytosis with left shift, while otherwise unremarkable. Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis was completed, and the results revealed open pressure 22 of cmH2O, pleocytosis, high protein and low glucose levels. EEG showed moderate to severe diffuse cortical dysfunction, considered metabolic encephalopathy. Her CT and MRI of the brain were completed, and both showed diffuse leptomeningeal process. 

Under the suspicion of TB meningitis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, HERZ and empirical ceftriaxone were given. CSF TB PCR was sent with the pending result. She was then admitted to our ward on 4/1 for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient was ADL dependent and lived in a nursing home. He was just admitted at GM ward 2 months ago for bedsore pressure wound infection and pneumonia. This time, according to medical record, fever up to 38 with massive amount of sputum developed for few days. There was consciouness change compared with baseline status, watery diarrhea. However, pus-coated bedsore pressure wound with foamy smell was noted as well. He was then sent to ED. At triage, vital sign shjowed febrile. Plastic surgeon was consulted on 5/14 and debridement was performed with subsequent wet dressing suggested. Septic workup was done with blood/wound pus and sputum yielded multiple drug-resistant microorganism. CXR showed RML+ LLL pneumonia patch. Vancomycin + Mepem was administered since 5/13. With the impression of stage IV sacral pressure sore complicated with bacteremia and healthcare associated pneumonia, he was admitted for further management.

Progressive general pain for 2 weeks and acute bilateral lower leg weakness for 1 week.","NEUR: [Present Illness]
This patient is a 67-year-old right-handed, vegetarian male who has history of HTN, DM and old CVA without sequelae. He was totally independent at baseline, and lives in a local temple.

According to the patient and family, he started to have weight loss without appetite change since 2 years ago, with a total loss of around 10 kg. He noticed slow atrophy of thigh muscles for a few months. He denied any palpitation, tremor, temperature intolerance or other symptoms. There were also no obvious fever, chills, productive cough, or bloody stool. He was vaccinated with 2nd dose of Moderna on 10/15, and noticed general malaise and discomfort on the next day. He noticed muscle soreness and tightness sensation on his fingers and right knee, and general soreness at back muscles and back and shoulder pain. However, he could still ride his motorbike to local clinic for injection and infusion (unknown medication), with only transient improvement each time, and he visited the clinic for a total of 4 times in 10days. His soreness only improved transiently, and progressed become more pain. On 10/25, he noticed that he had problem standing up and unsteady gait and knee buckling when standing up. He also noticed ""floating sensation"" at bilateral foot when walking. He denied falls or using cane for his unsteady gait, but would support by walk or objects sometimes when walking. He then went to 西園 hospital on 10/26 where lab data showed normal CK, but elevated CRP (9) and leukocytosis and highly elevated ALKP (700). There was also highly elevated PSA>1000. He also noticed intermittent fever these 2 weeks, and also back soreness for some time. There were no obvious diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, diurnal change, or obvious needle prickling/burning/sensory loss at toe and finger tips. 

Due to personal reasons, he discharged against medical advice and came to our ED for help on 10/28. Upon arrival vital signs at triage BP: 134/75 mmHg PR: 89/min SpO2: 98% Respirations: 20/min. Neurologist is consulted for evaluation of his lower limb weakness and numbness. NCV and EMG is done on 10/29, 1) sensory-predominant polyneuropathy with polyradiculopathy (or plexopathy) and bilateral median entrapment neuropathy across the wrists and 2) possible myopathic changes involving proximal muscles. He is then admitted to our ward for further workup and management.

On 11/01, an abdomen echo revealed a gallbladder stone, and a C+T+L spine MRI showed diffuse bone metastases with epidural metastasis at T4-6, causing cord compression and myelopathy. By 11/02, the patient underwent a C+A+P CT with contrast, which suggested prostate cancer with diffuse osteoblastic bone metastases. A whole-body bone scan on 11/04 confirmed diffuse axial and appendicular skeletal metastases. The patient underwent surgical intervention for spinal cord compression on 11/08, and a transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the prostate was performed on 11/09.

   We had been transfusing RBC 2U daily since 1/7. The HB level remained largely the same with occasional drops suggesting ongoing bleeding. Tarry stool also persisted. We connected a decompression bag to the PEG tube. Air and some dark brown fluid were drained out. There was fresh blood on 1/12 night and 1/13 so we arranged an EGD on 1/13 afternoon.

Progressive swallowing difficulty with body weight severe loss for 1 year","NEUR: This is a 69-year-old, non-vegetarian, right-handed male with previous medical history of: 
# hypothyroidism, diagnosed in 2019, under Eltroxin control
# gall stone, s/p cholecystectomy around 2016

The patient was a retired soldier and has been working as general secretary of a building(大樓總幹事) since 2000. His ADL and iADL function remained well before symptom occured. Initially, mild slurred speech without fluency impairment was noted by himself at Febuary 2020, while his friend or family did not report difficulty on conversation. He could still maintain diet as before but needs longer time to finish the meal, and mild drooling was known. Besides, left deviation when walking was also noticed, while relieved about 2 month later and no event of falling nor car accident was reported.

He later visited 臺北市立聯合醫院和平院區(Taipei City Hospital, Ho-Pin branch) and brain MRI was performed, which revealed high signal in bilateral corticospinal tract, while no definite diagnosis was made. Since around June 2020, diffuculty of understanding his speech was reported by his ex-wife. Dysphagia also progressed and easy-choking when drinking water was noted. His daily food intake decreased more than half as before, and could only receive sticky or jelly diet, which caused his body weight declined from 82kg to 67kg within recent 6 months. Moreover, drooling became more prominent due to his dysphagia, and led the patient to keep mouth open to prevent choking of saliva. Besides, constipation up to once per week, progressive exertional dyspnea were also noticed. He once received acupuncture and dysphagia improved for 1 day. These symptoms significantly interfered with his current job, especially when communicate with others, while other works such as typing, reading, financing remained intacted. An episode of slurred speech deterioration occured in the middle of September, which made his talk hardly be understood, while gradually relieved to baseline since June about 10 days later.

Throughout the disease course, the patient denied impairment of motor or sensory function of limbs and trunk except for bilateral toe numbness(像踩在水上) for more than 1 year. He also denied symptoms of headache, dizziness, chest tightness, chest pain, orthopnea, diarrhea, urinary urgency, nocturia, temperature intolerance, thirsty, paresis, postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, abnormal sweating. No related symptoms nor other neurologic diseases was noticed in his family.

He was admitted in 2020/09 with Brain MRI showed mild signal change along cortico-spinal tract (especially at right), and cervical spinal MRI showed stenosis at C4-5, C6-7. Video pharyngoesophagography was arranged which showed normal swallowing but increased oral and pharyngeal mucosal coating. Besides, NCV+ F study showed lumbosacral radiculopathy and EMG shwoed diffused motor neuropathy. Lung function test on 2020/09/25 showed Mild restrictive ventilatory defect, Pi max:-22 cmH2O, Pe max:22cmH2O. Riluzole (Laidec) were given for treatment.

After discharge, slowly progressive dysarthria and swallowing difficulty went on. He became unable to do smoking for poor inspiration in 2020/09. He resign from general secretary due to unintelligible speech in 2020/10, and had visited ER two times for SOB. Occasional BiPAP was used at home, but only 10-20 minutes a time, 2 times a month. He had to sleep in sitting position at night for better breath. Since 2020/11, he could only drink 1 bottle of formulated milk and 1 bottle water, with 1 bowl of porridge, while much of them just leaked from the mouth. He started doing cooking at home, but also find some progressive arm weakness when holding the pot and chop-knife. Besides, he mentioned taste change with hypergeusia sensation since then but family could still tolerate the meals. With persistent body weight change 59 -> 52kg in 2020/12 one month solely, he was admitted for PEG and second workup.

[History]
After the patient was admitted for PEG prior to the operation the patient already had syncope for 10-20 seconds was in the afternoon of 1/4 when the patient stood up from a sitting position. He did not hit the head. Blood pressure after consciousness recovery was 61/43. He denied history of orthostatic hypotension or fainting but reported some sort of arrhythmia a long time ago. He complained of occasional chest tightness and palpitation. EKG did not reveal any abnormality. We arranged Holter. SBP only improved to around 100 afterwards. Another episode of syncope was noted on 1/5 morning when he walked to the toilet and sat down. BP in supine seated and standing position did not vary by over 20. However after inquiry the patient's wife reported recent melena.
 PEG was smoothly done on 1/5 afternoon. Nevertheless CBC on 1/6 revealed significant HB drop (11.2 to 4.7) compared to 1/4. FAST showed negative for internal bleeding. Coagulation time was normal. Fibrinogen was not low. D-dimer was 2.78. The family reported 2 episodes of tarry stool (before PEG). NPO and high dose PPI with Transamin and IVF support were done. PRBC 4U were transfused on 1/6 with additional 2U on 1/7 and 2U on 1/8. His blood pressure improved but tachycardia was still present. HB on 1/7 night was 7.2. Tarry stool still persisted. A little fresh blood could be drawn from the PEG tube. 
Another episode of syncope was noted on 1/11 morning after he urinated. EGD on 1/11 afternoon did not reveal any bleeder or ulcer but incidentally found and retrieved a foreign body. It caused mild gastric erosion but could not explain the severe HB drop. Our GI doctor then suggested CTA. CTA was performed on 1/11 night but did not show any active bleeding.
 There was even fresh blood at 1/12 night and on 1/13 so we arranged an EGD on 1/13 afternoon. Fresh blood coming from the duodenum was noted. There was a clean duodenal ulcer without active bleeding at the time of examination hence no intervention was indicated. They suggested keeping PPI first. Later no more fresh blood came out of PEG tube and HB level steadily increased.
 On 1/14 morning his ex-wife (main caregiver) developed vertigo with vomiting. There was no focal neurological sign. She was sent to our ER and came back at noon with some drugs for her symptoms. She recovered well.
  Despite continuation of NPO with administration of high dose PPI and frequent transfusion his Hb only stabilized for 1-2 days on 1/14-15 with later bloody aspirates showing from the bag connecting to PEG and Hb drop found during 1/17-18. Therefore a family meeting was held on 1/18. Considering that his ALS could only deteriorate and further examination may require intubation the patient and his family members later opted for hospice care. Therefore our hospice team was consulted on 1/18.","2021-01-18

Duty Note - pre-syncope and nearly falling/nI was called at 6AM that the patient had one episode of nealy syncope after 下床要上廁所. 

According to his wife the patient would like to defecate at around 5AM so he woke up and walked to the bedside toilet and was able to sit on it but he did not defecate in the end (想大大不出來). He then standed up to wear the paints but then he felt sudden general weakness and suddenly fall forward but catched by his wife (太太有接住病人，沒有撞到頭). The nurse then immediately came to help the patient got back to the bed and checked vital signs which showed BP 93/61 mmHg and one touch sugar 142. Dark blood was noted form the PEG. 

He denied dizziness dyspnea nausea vomiting or abdomen pain.

1. 病患住院後上消化道出血，做過兩次胃鏡以及電腦斷層都沒有發現出血點，即便施打高劑量，最有可能是小腸或大腸仍有其他病灶，但是以ALS而言進一步檢查治療消化道出血並不會改變ALS疾病本身，所以病願意接受安寧緩和治療
2. 因為本周都使用靜脈點滴補充營養，非常容易栓塞出等併發症，一般需要打中央靜脈導管(CVC)使用全靜脈營養，但是剛剛問過病患本人，因為不能改變疾病本身，病患希望不要打中央靜脈導管
3. 病人及家屬在解釋後希望安寧緩和照護，今天會照會安寧照會醫師，或許可以轉6樓安寧團隊治療，等床期間也可以在目前病房接受安寧照護

 This is a 70-year-old male with:
- Bulbar onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) status post PEG placement on 1/5
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding and previous syncope with hypotension status post panendocsopy on 1/11 and 13 without finding active bleeder.
- Hypothyroidism diagnosed in 2019 on Eltroxin
- Gallstone s/p cholecystectomy in around 2016

I was consulted for palliative care and further care planning. In addition to complex clinical condition the total suffering was tremendous. The patient stated that he was not willing to receive CVC ETT/tracheostomy CPR or any life-sustaining interventions. He agreed with DNR and already signed ACP (based on 病人自主權利法) last year.

Bedside echo showed collapse IVC fair LVEF without pleural effusion or ascites. Fluid challenge with normal saline and albumin (total 50ml/kg) were administered for suspect septic shock and dehydration. Empiric Vancomycin and Tazocin were administered after completion of septic workup. However tachycardia up to 160-180/min was still found and CAP panel showed positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus. Due to suspect severe enterovirus infection stage 3A (hypertension tachycardia hyperglycemia) Primacor was infused for a brief time on 7/22 early morning and the distal perfusion improved under Primacor infusion. On 7/22 while clinical condition gradually stabilized we performed lumbar puncture for etiology survey. The open/close pressure was 33/19cmH2O. There was no pleocytosis or abnormal protein/glucose level. Later on the same date(7/22) the throat swab pan-EV PCR showed positive report. Collectively due to suspect enterovirus infection stage 3A with encephalitis IVIg(1g/kg/dose) was administered within 12 hours. Afterwards fever gradually subsided. The CRP and PCT gradually improved. The other pathogen survey (blood urine and CSF) all revealed negative results. The specimen for CDC enterovirus survey and ID laboratory evaluation were still pending for formal report(,,). 

Afterwards we kept primacor to improve better distal perfusion since 7/22. However frequent episodic hypertension (SBP 140-160) with irregular bradycardia (HR 60-80) was noted especially while the patient was awake or being touched or under treatment (sputum suction chest care...). Since ScvO2 was less than 70 we uptitrated Primacor to improve distal perfusion. Besides due to suspect IICP signs mannitol was administered since 7/23 under neurologist's suggestion. On 7/25 the neurologist impressed the above episodic hypertension with irregular bradycardia as autonomic dysregulation related to enterovirus brainstem encephalitis and suggested we pursue brain MRI survey for acute phase demage evaluation and prognosis. Besides since distal perfursion improved we tapered Primacor gradually and tried off Primacor on 7/28 to perform brain MRI. The brain MRI on 7/28 showed faintly uptake at dorsal pons and dorsal medulla suggestive of brainstem encephalitis. Since there was no brain edema mannitol was tapered off. Piracetam was added to improve distal perfusion. Besides the distal perfusion was normal while we gradually taper down Primacor. Besides since mild brainstem encephalitis was impressed by neurologist and radiologist we tried taper down continuous sedation and muscle relaxant and found the patient could have normal consciousness level (E4VTM6 under D3N1.7) normal muscle power cough reflex and spontaneous breathing. Therefore we would gradually taper ventilator setting and prepare for extubation in recent days.

[Present Illness]   
This is a 8month-11day-old male infant with no known underlying diseases. He was delivered via scheduled C/S at 禾馨, without perinatal insults. The prenatal examination and newborn screen results were all within normal range. Afterwards, except for episodic gastric regurgitation when he was 1-2month-old, the baby boy received regular health care checkup at well baby clinic, received vaccination as scheduled, and had achieved normal growth and developmental milestones. 

This time, according to the father, mild cough was noted since 7/20 afternoon. Afterwards, post-prandial vomiting with infant formula and soup was found on 7/20 night(8PM). Furthermore, poor appetite, irritable crying and increased work of breathing with strange breathing sounds were found since then. Since the baby appeared respiratory distress, the parents brought the baby to 忠孝醫院 first, where COVID-19 PCR showed negative report. Upon arrival to 忠孝醫院, the SpO2 was 95% in ambient air and could reach up to 99-100% under O2 hood support. However, due to progressive respiratory distress with retraction, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. At ER triage, vital signs showed BT 37.9'C, HR 180/min, BP 105/80, RR 40/min, SpO2 97%. Afterwards, SpO2 deteriorated to 85-89% in ambient air, associated with retraction. Therefore, intubation with 4.5# cuffed endotracheal tube was performed at ER, and he was transferred to 8PE for further evaluation and treatment.","PED: *8m11d male infant

DIAGNOSIS: Suspected enterovirus encephalitis
SUGGESTION: 1. We'll arrange brain sonography and TCD for evaluation.
2. Arrange 24-hr EEG for current cerebral function evaluation. 
3. Arrange brain MRI with and without contrast for evaluation. 
4. Pending analysis of enterovirus subtype. 
5. Keep mannitol for elevated RI/PI level, tapper or titrate according to clinical conditions.",2022-07-25,"# Patient presented with impending shock, tachycardia, and poor perfusion, suspecting sepsis, dehydration, or myocarditis.
# Developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation.
# Aspiration pneumonia is suspected.
# The patient's current condition and response to treatment are not explicitly stated in the provided records, but the presence of respiratory failure and suspected sepsis or myocarditis indicates a critical condition.
# Intubation was performed due to respiratory failure.
# The patient's vital signs and laboratory results from the past week are not provided, making it difficult to assess the patient's current response to treatment.
# Further evaluation and management of the patient's condition are necessary to determine the effectiveness of the current treatment plan.","This week, the 8-month-11-day-old male infant was admitted to the intensive care unit with respiratory distress, which progressed to impending shock, requiring intubation on 07/21. The patient was diagnosed with suspected severe enterovirus infection, respiratory failure, and shock with tachycardia and poor perfusion. On 07/22, the patient received IVIg, and Primacor was initiated to manage autonomic dysfunction. The patient's condition fluctuated, with episodes of hypertension and poor distal perfusion, but showed improvement in capillary refilling time and mottling skin. By 07/28, the patient's fever had subsided, and the brain MRI revealed subtle brainstem encephalitis. The patient remains on ventilator support, and Primacor is being tapered. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans for follow-up brain MRI and EEG to assess prognosis and guide further treatment.",PED

This is a 50-year-old man with past history of:
1. Pulmonary tuberculosis, status post Nonintubated (LMA) uniportal VATS LUL proper segmentectomy wedge resection + Gr. 5/6,7,10,11,12 lymph node dissection on 2017/07/24, status post HERZ medications in 2017/08/01-2018/01/28.
2. Colorectal polyps, status post polypectomy in 2016.
3. Appendicitis, status post appendectomy in 2002.

The patient reported dry throat in recent months, weight loss of 5 kg(60 kg to 55 kg) in recent 1 year. He also experienced sour taste, hiccups and heartburn sensation after meal for 5 years, which relieved after taking 張國周強胃散. There was no dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, coughing, hoarseness, nor chest pain.

The patient went to 聯安診所 for health examination on 2021/02/23, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy revealed ulcer with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. He sought medical attention at 上海復旦大學附屬腫瘤醫院, the esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 2021/04/07 showed esophageal ulcer, the endoscopic ultrasound on 2021/04/09 showed esophageal tumor, cT1a?N0M0, 25-26.5 cm from incisor. He went to Dr. 李章銘's outpatient clinic on 2021/04/29, after discussion, he was admitted to our ward for further evaluation on 2021/06/16. Upon arrival, the vital signs were stable. Physical examination showed no abnormal findings. Abdominal echo revealed parenchymal liver disease.

This is a 62-year-old, right-handed, non-vegetarian woman with a medical history of:
- Type 2 Diabetes mellitus, under Saxagliptin, Metformin.
- Hyperlipidemia, under Rosuvastatin.

The patient is ADL/iADL totally independent at baseline. According to the patient's daughter, who lives with her, the patient was observed with stuttering and easy choking since around 2022/01. The symptoms progressed, as by 2022/05, she could barely speak a word, with normal comprehension. No facial palsy, sensory deficit or limb weakness was complained. Since around 2022/06, diplopia was also complained. No ptosis, diurnal change, dizziness or visual field defect was noted. Due to the above symptoms with deterioration, her family took her to NTUH Beiu branch neurology OPD for further evaluation.

At OPD, tongue atrophy with fasciculation was observed, with extraocular muscle movement limitation of the left lateral rectus also noted. For further survey, brain MRI was arranged on 2022/08/23, and reported ventriculomegaly with mild brain atrophy, but no definite organic lesion in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and brain stem. NCV and EMG studies were also arranged on 09/01, which reported findings compatible with (1) a motor neuropathy or
neuronopathy with active denervation changes, (2) coexisting entrapment neuropathy of bilateral median nerves at the wrists. She was then referred to NTUH Dr.薛學文's OPD on 09/23, when her symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia and diplopia persisted. She was then admitted this time on 2022/09/27 for further examination.

The results of the repetitive stimulation test showed equivocal decremental changes at rest or after exercise.
The electromyography study showed:
(1) a few active denervation changes and a few neurogenic polyphasic waves with reduced recruitment in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle 
(2) a few active denervation changes and equivocal neurogenic polyphasic waves in the right tibialis anterior muscle 
(3) equivocal to some neurogenic polyphasic waves in the right
sternocleidomastoid the right biceps brachii and the right quadriceps muscles.
The above findings may suggest:
(1) an early motor neuron disease or neuromuscular junction disorder 
(2) bilateral median entrapment neuropathies across the wrist 
(3) right ulnar entrapment neuropathy across the elbow.

[Chief complaint]
Progressive dysarthria and dysphagia for 8 months.

[Present illness]
This is a 62-year-old right-handed non-vegetarian woman with a medical history of:
- Type 2 Diabetes mellitus under Saxagliptin Metformin.
- Hyperlipidemia under Rosuvastatin.

The patient is ADL/iADL totally independent at baseline. According to the patient's daughter who lives with her the patient was observed with stuttering and easy choking since around 2022/01. The symptoms progressed as by 2022/05 she could barely speak a word with normal comprehension. No facial palsy sensory deficit or limb weakness was complained. Since around 2022/06 diplopia was also complained. No ptosis diurnal change dizziness or visual field defect was noted. Due to the above symptoms with deterioration her family took her to NTUH Beiu branch neurology OPD for further evaluation.

At OPD tongue atrophy with fasciculation was observed with extraocular muscle movement limitation of the left lateral rectus also noted. For further survey brain MRI was arranged on 2022/08/23 and reported ventriculomegaly with mild brain atrophy but no definite organic lesion in the cerebral hemispheres cerebellum and brain stem. NCV and EMG studies were also arranged on 09/01 which reported findings compatible with (1) a motor neuropathy or neuronopathy with active denervation changes (2) coexisting entrapment neuropathy of bilateral median nerves at the wrists. She was then referred to NTUH Dr.薛學文's OPD on 09/23 when her symptoms of dysarthria dysphagia and diplopia persisted. She was then admitted this time on 2022/09/27 for further examination.

DIAGNOSIS: A： 
1.經濟問題：普通，病人雖為低收入戶，每個月領23,800元補助津貼及6,000元房屋補助津貼，生活尚可維持。
2.照顧問題：病人獨居，住院中如有照顧需要，需協助聘僱看護。姊姊會以病人社福生活津貼來支付看護費用差額。
3.家庭與社會支持功能：不佳。病人長年獨居，過去因行為問題及家產分配與其他手足關係破裂，僅剩姊姊會出面協助。家庭支持系統不佳，家庭與社會支持功能不佳。
SUGGESTION: P：社工計畫/建議：
1.向家屬說明低收身分申請醫療補助和看護補助福利說明。如符合申請條件，將協助送件社會局申請。
2.預期病人癒後不佳，家屬尋求機構安置。姊姊轉述，病人之前負氣時，曾表示自己的身後事拒家人處理，要委由社會局出面處理。提供家屬慈善團體喪葬資源單位。
3.持續追蹤。

[Present illness]
Tracking back to her history, on 2008-2009, she first developed syndrome of dyspnea. Then, she was diagnosed of acute pulmonary edema due to acute renal failure. She started peritoneal dialysis since then and shifted to hemodialysis on 2011 due to peritonitis. Left upper limb AV-fistula was implanted on 2012. Renal transplanation was considered by Dr.蔡孟昆 on 2013/11. However, the pre-transplantation evaluation
accidentally showed heart failure LVEF: 23.7(2013/11/07). Mild jaundice was also noted (2013/11/14 T-Bil:2.14) and echo showed mild splenomegaly on 2013/10/03 during pre-transplant evaluation. Renal transplantation was held and she was followed up at cardiovascular OPD. Cardiac echo showed that the left ventricle is dilated and left ventricular systolic function is severely reduced with LVEF: 21.6 %. EMB was performed and pathology showed hypertrophy. Exercise lung function test showed VO2: 13.64 ml/min/kg. Lung function test showed FVC: 52.5% and FEV1: 54.6%. Vascular duplex showed (1) Mild atherosclerosis in bilateral carotid bulbs without significant hemodynamic changes. (2) Adequate total VA flow amount. On 2015/7, due to heart and kidney donation both available, she was immediately admitted and underwent Heart & kidney co-transplantation on 2015/7/24; post-operative donor heart showed fair biventricle contractility and urination was sucessful with lasix given intraoperatively. The patient kept OPD follow up with FK-56 for transplantation. Protocol renal biopsy was performed smoothly on 2017/10/25, 2020/08/06, which both showed no rejection pathologically.
  The patient had been under her usual status until three days ago on 2022/12/09, when right lower abdominal pain with fevers, hematuria, several times of nausea and vomiting developed. She then visited emergency deapartment of NTUH for further evaluation. At triage, vtial signs were as followed: blood pressure 124/77mmHg, pulse rate 124/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 38.4℃, SPO2 100％. The physical examination revealed no abnormalities except tenderness over right lower abdomen. The blood test showed leukocytosis(17K) with segment predominant(91%), elevate lactic acid(2.46), elevated serum creatinine(2.7). The urine analysis showed RBC 10-19/HPF, WBC >=100. The SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test revealed negative. The KUB showed prominent fecal material and colon gas. Under the impression of urinary tract infection, Ceftriaxone was administered for infection control and novamin was given for vomiting. The patient then tranferred to our ward for further management on 2022/12/13. The antibiotic treatment, closely monitor vital signs were kept at general ward. The fever subsided after antibiotic treatment. The f/p urine analysis revealed RBC (Sediment):0-2/HPF, WBC (Sediment):6-9/HPF. Under stable condition, the patient was discharged on 2022/12/18 with OPD f/p arranged. 
  However, fevers with vomiting developed on 2022/12/25. She visited emergency department of NTUH on 12/26. At triage, vital signs were as followed:BP: 118/91 mmHg PR: 120/min SpO2: 99% Respirations: 22/min BT: 39.4 C. The lab data revealed leukocytosis(24K), elevated creatinine(2.3), elevated total bilirubib(1.77). The urine analysis sohowed pyuria. Recurrent urinary tract infection was suspected. Invanz was administered. The patient was then tranaferred to our ward for further care.

TURBT and TURP done on 2021/3/12 revealed califlowerlike tumor over left lateral to bladder neck with prostatic urethra involvement. Pathology showed papillary urothelial carcinoma T1 high grade in bladder and T2 high grade in prostate. CT on 3/22 showed bladder cancer cT2N0M0. Bone scan revealed no bone metastasis. Radical cystoprostatectomy was suggested but families hesitated.

After that, they visted our Uro OPD for second opinion. He under re-TURBT on 2021/04/23, and cauligflower-like tumor at bladder neck 12 o'clock site and uneven erythematous mucosa at left lateral wall near UO were found. Pathology report showed non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, high-grade. MDP protocol was given afterwards. There was no gross hematuria, dysuria, decreased appetite noticed after discharged. He reported decreased urine amount but denied bilateral leg edema. 3-month cystoscopy and biopsy was performed on 2021/07/30. Intraoperative findings showed no gross tumor in the bladder; previous scar coating with debris over the left lateral wall and 12 o'clock of bladder neck, status post transurethral resection; and uneven erythematous mucosa at the left lateral wall, status post biopsy. Pathology reported carcinoma in situ.

Yet persistent oozing over catheter puncture site was noticed at that night with blood loss approximately 500ml. Wound compression and pRBC transfusion were done and the bleeding was stopped afterwards. She remained in a relatively stable condition with mild dizziness. We kept diuretics use with tentative targeted body weight of 53kg according to her urine amount. We consulted PM/R for cadiopulmonary rehabilitation and dietitcian for diet education for heart failure patient. She was planned to be discharged two days after Targocid treatment was completed. Nevertheless dyspnea with cold sweating and mild epigastralgia developed on 2021/5/7 afternoon. There was no chest pain radiation pain chest tightness nausea/vomiting diarrhea fever or chillness. She was hemodynamically stable and consciousness clear. Lab tests revealed leukocytosis lactic acidosis acute respiratory acidosis and pyuria. There was no significant elevation of cardiac enzymes. Chest X-ray and EKG showed relatively stationary results compared to the previous examination. Urosepsis with pulmonary decompensation was impressed so empirical cefepime was prescribed and BiPAP was applied. Her family confirmed their will of DNR and signed the permit.,"After admission to our intensive care unit Levophed was kept and fluid challenge with normal saline was given for shock. Levophed was discontinued on 2021/04/22. Atrial flutter was noted subsequently amiodarone 1# QD was given for pharmacologic cardioversion since 2021/04/23. EP specialist Dr. 黃惠君 was consulted for electrophysiology study but radiofrequency ablation was not suggested. Plavix was replaced with apixaban on 2021/04/23. However hypotension was noted on 2021/04/24 subsequently Levophed was given and septic workup was performed. Urine analysis showed bacteriuria subsequently empirical antibiotics with cefepime were given. Levophed was discontinued on 2021/04/26. Blood cultures later yielded MR-CoNS and Bacillus thuringiensis subsequently teicoplanin was added on 2021/04/25. Cefepime was de-escalated to ceftazidime on 2021/04/28. She was transferred to our general ward in relatively stable condition on 2021/04/29.

After transfer to our general ward we discontinued ceftazidime due to lack of culture evidence on 2021/04/30 and added Entresto 100 mg 0.25# QD for heart failure. Coronary angiography will be performed on 2021/05/03 for evaluation of reduced LVEF.","MED: Informant:Patient and her sons
Bilateral dorsal feet edema with right big toe erythema for a week; chest tightness for a week","MED: This is a 87-year-old woman with underlying history of:
# Coronary artery disease, 2-vessel-disease, status post percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting to left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery in 2000 and 2004
# Heart failure, preserve ejection fraction (LVEF: 53.1%, 2018/08/21)

She was ADL independent and was under regular follow-up at Dr.王宗道's outpatient clinic for coronary artery disease. This time, bilateral dorsal feet edema with right big toe erythema developed since a week ago. Also, she complained of mid chest pain with radiation to back at the same time. Otherwise, she denied fever, chills, dyspnea, oliguria, peripheral edema or other discomfort. She was brought to a local clinic at first, where she was told of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. Diuretics with oral Furosemide and Trichlormethiazide were prescribed, and her dorsal feet edema resolved much. However, her chest pain persisted, and hypotension was noted at home incidentally on 4/22. Though no dizziness, syncope, palpitation or other discomfort was noted, she was brought to our ER for further evaluation. On triage, her vital signs showed hypotension and mild tachycardia (Blood Pressure: 76/49mmHg, Pulse Rate: 99/min,
Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 36.2℃). Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly but no pulmonary congestion. EKG revealed atrial flutter. Blood exam showed no leukocytosis but elevation of lactate, BUN and Creatinine level, and hyponatremia was also noted. For impending shock status, Levophed and Albumin were administered. For further evaluation of possible acute heart failure and suspected cardiogenic shock, she was admitted to CCU.

Plan: [Disposition]
Pending ward transfer under stable condition

# UTI/ORCONS bacteremia
- Keep ceftazidime since 4/28 pending culture study.
- Keep definitive teicoplanin for ORCONS bacteremia for 14 
 days.
- Follow B/C Q3D (next: 05/01) if still positive consider 
 TTE/TEE.
- Taper solu-cortef gradually..
- Keep I/O balanced as possible.

# Atrial flutter CHADS2-VASc=6 HAS-BLED = 2
- Keep apixaban 2.5 mg BID for Af and CAD.
- Titrate up Amiodarone to 1# BID
- VS王宗道: Give medical cardioversion first with Cordarone 
 discuss about ablation/cath and further PPM later.
- Consider electrical cardioversion if refractory to 
 medication? Monitor possible atrial thrombus.

# Drop in LVEF
- Cardiologist Dr.王宗道: arrange CAG on 05/03 for study.
- Add back HF medications (ARB B-blocker Aldactone) if more 
 stable BP and renal function.

His dailiy activity was totally independent. He was regularly followed her underlying disease at our hospital(Hema VS田豐銘 and RT VS江韻).

Eighteen months prior to this admission, he was diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with initial presentation of enlarged left scrotum for 2 months. He sought medical attention at Taiwan Adventist Hospital. MRI revealed a possible left testicular lesion, and operation was suggested. Left radical orchiectomy was performed on 2020/09/29 smoothly, and the lesion turned out to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to pathological specimen. Microscopically, it shows centroblast-like large lymphoid cells infiltrating within testicular parenchyma, paratesticular soft tissue, and perivascular soft tissue in spermatic cord. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells are positive for CD20 while negative for CD3, PLAP, CD117, and SALL4. Further studies show that the tumor cells are positive for BCL6, MUM1, BCL2. They are negative for CD5, SOX11, EBER, CD10(very weak), c-Myc(30% immunoreactivity). Ki-67 proliferative index is about 80%. Then he was referred to National Taiwan University Cancer Center for further chemotherapy. Staging PET showed a mild inguinal hot spot and a left maxillary sinus/left maxilla (related to poor dental condition?), bone marrow biopsy was free for lymphoma involvement. He received the 6 cycles of R-CHOP, 3 cycles TIT, and consolidative RT for left inguinal from 2021/05/06-2021/06/02, then he was followed regularly at Hema VS田豐銘 outpatient department per 2 months.

However, since October. 2021 he noticed he had numbness sensation and paresthesia started from his left 1st, 2nd, 3th finger and bilateral toes. Later the toes discomfort extended to his bilateral legs (mid-calves), more prominent over the ventral part. Vitamin B12 supplement was suggested at the outpatient department, but the symptom continued. In December. 2021, his left finger symptoms extended to his left whole arm and neck. Besides, right eyelid drooping with diplopia were also noted. So he had visited the ophthalmology clinic and hospital several times without definite eyes problems.

Moreover, left arm weakness was found around January. 2022. He was admitted for further workup. Brain and spine MRI was nondiagnostic. The CSF exam suggested lymphoma with CNS involvement. PET scan on 2/17 revealed hypermetabolic changes along C4-C7 left brachial plexus and bilateral tibial nerves. Malignancy infiltration was considered. We started salvage therapy with R-DHAP, D1= 2/18 ( Rituximab 1400 mg D1, Cisplatin 100mg/m2 24hr D1, Cytarabine 2000mg/m2 D2, Betamethasone), which was followed by partial improvement of left upper limb numbness and muscle power, and improved EOM of the right eye. 

This time at the admission, the EOM of the bilateral eyes were symmetrical and without limitation. The numbness over the lef upper limb improved a lot and the sensation changed to soreness, and the numbness over the other extremities almost disappeared. He denied fever, chills, abdominal pain, dysuria, blurred vision, muscle weakness, unsteady gait and other discomfort. This time, the patient was admitted for cycle 2 R-DHAP, bone marrow study, and the preparation of peripheral blood stem cell harvesting.

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated in 書田 and 新光, the condition was stable. However since half year ago, significant body weight loss from 65kg to 51kg was noted withing half years, associated with poor appetite and easy abdominal fullness, mild orthopnea and pedal edema. Orthopnea and pedal edema can be relieved by diuretics. He went to LMD for help and abdominal echo showed multiple liver tumor, thus he was referred to our OPD for help. Tumor marker on 2022/10/26 showed CEA 1.78, CA 19-9 26.7, Alpha-Fetoprotein 20.86. CT abdomen with contrast on 2022/11/03 showed multiple metastatic tumors in liver; extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy; suspected bilateral adrenal mets; infiltrative lesions in right kidney; suspected lung mets; ascites and bilateral pleural effusion.
There was no abdominal pain, no tarry or bloody stool, no nausea or vomiting, no diarrhea and no change in bowel movement.
Due to the above condition, he underwent CT guide biopsy for left paraaortic L.N smoothly without complication on 2022/11/16. Pathology report that under IHC stain, these cells are positive for cytokeratin, CK20, SATB2, negative for CK7 and NKX3.1 stains. Taken together, it is compatible with metastatic adenocarcinoma reminiscent of the colonic origin involving the stroma. The patient then received colonoscopy examination on 2022/12/06, one 2.5 cm ulcerative patch was found at 10 cm AAV, biopsy was done and its pathology showed rectal adenocarcinoma. Further RAS mutation, BRAF mutation analysis, and PMS2 + MSH6 IHC were sent. Current was still pending report.

Until now, the patient had reported prominent weight loss for 18 kilograms in the past one year (68Kg->50kg). Anorexia was reported as well with daily intake around 2 cans of 褐速康, 600kcal. Other recent discomfort included intermittent tenesmus, dyspnea on exertion (need to get rest after walk for 30m, but would greatly improved after thoracentesis) and dry cough. He denied bloody/tarry stool, pencil-like stool or diarrhea. Due to recent aftermentioned symptoms, the patient was admitted this time for further care. Upon admission, phyiscal examination showed abdominal fullness without tenderness. Breathing sound was mildly decreased on bilateral lower lung field. Lab data showed increased LDH to 911 U/L and elevated creatinine to 1.4 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL). Supporitve care and TPN would be prescribed. Further anti-cancer therapy would be discussed and arranged after mutation study was completed.

This time, patient was admitted for rapid decline of her functional status. In 2022/7, her BADL and IADL were totally independent, and no chocking had happened before. She could even hike with her friends, walk for a long distance and take a good care of her family. Two fall histories happened in 2022/6 and 2022/7, but they didn't induce fracture. However, patient's BADL and IADL changed from independent to totally dependent in 3 weeks since 2022/8, and massive assistance was necessary when walking. Poor appetite was noted since 2022/8. Patient also complained about urinary incontinence and, sometimes, fecal incontinence. Acute change of health status leaded to a bad mood. For example, patient said that she felt unhappy and had no any interests in this month, and she didn't want to meet her friends. Although no financial burden was noted, care givers, patient's son and daughter, seemed to be under a significant pressure and feel upset. 

Dyspnea when laying down, sitting up and standing, dizziness, fatigue, cold intolerance, frequency and nocturia, weakness of four limbs, insomnia due to pain, and slight memory loss was noted in 2022/8. No fever, gastrointestine tract upset, dysuria or decrease in urinary output was mentioned. PE showed no ascites, normal capillary refilling time, no muscle weakness, pink conjunctiva and icteric sclera.

Lab data revealed low RBC, Hb and HCT, and also high WBC and hsCRP. High BUN, UA and Ca was noted, and the eGFR was 39.4. LDH was high, 1485. Urine bacteria was noted but there was no pyuria. High urine albumin and creatinine, and Albumin/Creatinine was 80.

Patient also complained about pain over lower back and xiphoid process. It was said that intermittent shoulder pain was noted in 2022/5 but relieved in about 2022/7. VAS pain score was 3/10. Pain over lower back and xiphoid process started at 2022/8 and the VAS pain score was 9/10. Stretching exacerbated the pain and there was no way to relieve the symptom. Carer giver was eager to learn the technique to care because she didn't knew how to deal with the pain.

PE revealed no wound, rash, redness or swelling was noted. Patient can localize the pain precisely. Bone metastasis was noted in previous outpatient clinic.

會談對象: 女兒
會談內容: 
 病人已婚，育有一子一女。病人於2007年診斷胃腸道基質細胞瘤，進行多次治療，但後續發現有肝臟、腹膜，以及骨頭轉移。自2022/08起，病人的生活自理能力大幅減退，情緒低落，背痛明顯，門診發現有骨轉移，此次因疾病進展住院治療。目前等待MRI檢查結果，決定進一步的治療方向。因疾病末期、預後不佳，原團隊建議同時安寧照顧，病人已表示DNR（全拒）意願，故原團隊照會安寧共照。

 今團隊訪視，病人睡眠中，躺臥床上休息，呼吸平順。團隊關心不適症狀，女兒表示目前比較疼痛，尤其翻身/擦澡活動時，女兒顯不捨。過去都是媽媽就診，兒女雖然知道狀況，但看到媽媽一個人自己默默做了治療，也相當不捨和辛苦，剛好原團隊今日會做核磁共振檢查，團隊解釋，緩和團隊的加入，是一起幫助家人和媽媽一起面對疾病，幽谷伴行，解釋安寧緩和可讓末期病人有更佳的生活品質，著重於症狀緩解及身心靈照護，會與原團隊治療併行，並不會縮短或是延長病人的壽命，團隊也會盡量幫忙疼痛與緩和相關護理的照顧，團隊也肯定女兒照顧的孝順，告知媽媽都了解大家的孝心，團隊也肯定媽媽自己做決定(DNR全拒)的勇敢。
  團隊介紹安寧緩和共照等照護模式，家屬表示了解。團隊給予家人陪伴支持，後續將持續關心評估。

 今團隊訪視，病人睡眠中，躺臥床上休息，可點搖頭，但部分語言無法辨識，呼吸平順。女兒表示因為病人之前想回家，所以家人想完成病人心願，但是擔心病人在半途就往生，也擔心後續照顧，更增加病人不適。

詢問病人本人意願，亡夫2016年在台大醫院病逝，之後葬儀社協助帶亡夫回家，詢問病人病危想法，病人同意和亡夫一樣，表示家裡東西太多了，所以不適合。

今天心理師探視，轉達會談內容，放不下小孩與妹妹，二人表示不知道，不捨流淚，表示後續家人有共識，希望以病人舒適就好，兒子剛好回家拿東西，已協助轉達兒子，病人希望在醫院往生，後續關心續關心照顧。

會談內容: 
  病人表示昨天病人意識較清楚時，表示想回家，女兒表示回家照護壓力大，後續如果真的需要也要請看護，表示自己已多日未回家看自己的小孩(小一.3歲)，詢問病人回家想法，病人許多語言無法辨識，表示要回家整理家裡，於以說明回家需要準備的事情，以及後續要面對的事情，病人同意先住院，後續仍確定是希望在醫院往生。

今天探視病人時，ROOM air spo2 82%，詢問後續如果無不適，是否可以接受不用氧氣，平順地離開，病人點頭同意。

女兒表示案夫死亡後仍有3件事未完成，1.老家整修，目前已在進行。2.整理家裡，因為病人生活忙碌，參加許多社團活動，不捨丟棄，所以目前沒有進展。
3.兒子未婚，陸續以相親10次，但目前仍無對象。

於以說明目前病人無體力，回家也無法整理家裡，建議可以把不放心，或想整理的地方，跟小孩說，請小孩協助，後續兒子，也會有案女，陪伴照顧，引導四道。

Fever was noted at night after septic workup antibiotics was upgrade to Cefepime. However fever persisted on 6/18; for better coverage of anaerobic pathogen we shifted to Tazocin. Due to post-AKI diuretic phase he was relative dehydration and the level of sodium was increasing. However his LVEF was only 40% so we increased oral hydration rather than iv fluid.

The patient was a heavy smoker with 1PPD for 50+ years. He had productive coughs and intermittent dyspnea, and was diagnosed with COPD in 2009. In 2009-2021, he had experienced 8 times of COPD with acute exacerbation and 8 times of community-acquired pneumonia; the last time was in 2021/03. Currently he was using Trelegy Ellipta for maintenance medication. The patient lives in an apartment on 17th floor with his wife, and was totally independent in activities of daily living. He was able to walk and ride bicycle everyday. However, He needed nasal cannula with 1L/min overnight since last discharge.

He had suffered from general weakness for days before this admission. He fell to the ground this noon with his head hitting the ground. There was no nausea, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. However, he developed sudden onset of dyspnea (SpO2 50% under O2 at home) with productive coughs and chest pain; radiation pain to the back was also mentioned. O2 mask 10 L/min was given by EMT on the way to the hospital. Upon arrival at 16:59 his vital signs were BT: 37.2'C, PR: 30/min, Respirations: 30/min, and SpO2: 100%. Apparent accessory muscle use was noted. Endotracheal tube insertion was suggested to his son through telephon soon after ED arrival, but his son hesitated. The patient then lost consciousness and became pulseless with the initial rhythm being PEA (at 17:27). Emergent CPCR was initiated. Blood test showed hyperkalemia (8.45), elevated lactate (4.63), mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (VBG pH 6.98, pCO2 53.3, pO2 25.4, HCO3 12.2), and worsened renal function (crea 3.4, BUN 99.6). 

ROSC was achieved 17 mins after CPCR without electric shock (at 17:44). EKG performed after ROSC showed ST elevation in lead II, III, aVF, and V4R-V6R. Repeated EKG demonstrated gradual resolution of the ST elevation in the next 2 hours. UCG showed a LVEF around 40% and no pericardial effusion. COVID-19 antigen rapid screening and PCR via nasopharyngeal swab were both negative. Serial follow-up showed improved potassium level(7.0) and acidemia(7.099), and an emergent whole body CT scan showed right upper lung GGO and no ICH. He was then admitted to MICU for further care.

K-lowering strategy was adopted after admission along with intravenous diuretics. The possiblitiy of renal replacement therapy for K removal was informed to the family but RRT was not used in the end due to success in K excretion. His urine output was significant under diuresis and K level lowered to normal value in the following days. Serial follow-up also showed gradual normalization of cardiac biomarkers and liver enzymes whose initial elevation were both thought to be related to the CPCR process. Extubation was performed smoothly on 06/15 and he exhibited smooth respiratoy pattern afterwards. IV hydration was given due to progressive hypernatremia azootemia and metabolic alkalosis; dehydration from previous diuresis was favored. Under a relative stable condition he was transferred to the general ward on 2021/06/16.","2021-06-16

Sudden desaturation was noticed at 14:40 on 08/16 suspected airway collapse or sputum impaction. The condition soon stabilized after ventilator was connected back (PSV 12/5/0.35). O2 collar was tried again since 08/16 night and he tolerated well. Intermittent suffocation episodes were still noticed on 08/18 and 08/19 both improved immediately after sputum suction. Bronchoscopy was performed on 08/19 and it showed only abundant sputum with no stricture. We also consulted ENT for tracheal tube suggestions and Bivona was suggested. We also started regular inner tracheal tube cleaning to prevent sputum impaction. His WBC dropped to 910 on 08/20 so G-CSF was given.,"After transferring to ICU CVC was inserted on 08/11 for chemotherapy.

1 month history of face and neck swelling","MED: This 71-year-old male smoker has background history of diabetes mellitus.

He works as a cleaner and lives by himself. His wife and three daughters live in Phillipine. Only his son stays in Taipei. He has regular follow up at 馬偕 hospital for diabetes.

He has a chronic cough with white sputum for a long time. One month ago, he started to notice face swelling and went to a local clinic. This was suspected due to allergy and he was given with some medication. However, symptoms didn't improve and he began to have neck swelling, sore throat and skin itchiness. This was not responded to anti-histamine. There was no weight loss, appetite change, hemoptysis, shortness of breath or fever. Since symptoms didn't improve, he went to 中興 hospital today. CT was performed and he was adviced to come to teaching hospital for further management. Thus he came to our emergency department today.

His initial vital signs were temperature 36.7℃, heart rate 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 per minute, blood pressure 205/95mmHg and saturation 98%. Blood test revealed microcytic anemia (Hb 9.7g/dL) and raised creatinine level (1.9mg/dL) without known baseline. His CT scan from 中興 hospital showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, right upper lung mass and mild fibrotic changes bilaterally. Due to suspected super vena cava syndrome with aiway compromise, he was intubated and transferred to intensive care unit for further management.

His facial swelling gradually improved after the chemotherapy. PSV 7/5/0.35 was tried on 08/16 and he could breathe smoothly for 3 hours. Therefore ventilator was off and was switched to O2 collar 40% 10L/min. Sudden desaturation was noticed at 14:40 on 08/16 suspected airway collapse or sputum impaction. The condition soon stabilized after ventilator was connected back (PSV 12/5/0.35). O2 collar was tried again since 08/16 night and he tolerated well. His O2 demand gradually decreased to 28% 5L/min.","2021-08-14

His facial swelling gradually improved after chemotherapy. 730 ml left pleural effusion was drained on 08/13. His facial swelling gradually improved after the chemotherapy. PSV 7/5/0.35 was tried on 08/16 and he could breathe smoothly for 3 hours. Therefore ventilator was off and was switched to O2 collar 40% 10L/min. Sudden desaturation was noticed at 14:40 on 08/16 suspected airway collapse or sputum impaction. The condition soon stabilized after ventilator was connected back (PSV 12/5/0.35). O2 collar was tried again since 08/16 night and he tolerated well. Intermittent suffocation episodes were still noticed on 08/18 and 08/19 both improved immediately after sputum suction. Bronchoscopy was performed on 08/19 and it showed only abundant sputum with no stricture. We also consulted ENT for tracheal tube suggestions and Bivona was suggested. We also started regular inner tracheal tube cleaning to prevent sputum impaction. His WBC dropped to 910 on 08/20 so G-CSF was given.

On 08/13, a PET scan revealed multiple FDG-avid malignancies, and 730 ml of left pleural effusion was drained. The patient was weaned off the ventilator and switched to an O2 collar, initially at 40% 10L/min, then adjusted to 35% 8L/min on 08/17, and further tapered to 28% 5L/min on 08/18. Despite episodes of desaturation, the patient tolerated the O2 collar well after sputum suction and BVM bagging. Bronchoscopy on 08/19 showed no stricture but abundant sputum, leading to a consultation with ENT, who suggested changing the tracheal tube to a Bivona tube. The patient's WBC dropped to 910 on 08/20, and filgrastim was administered. In a relatively stable condition, the patient was transferred to the general ward on 08/21.",MED

  Her ADL was partially dependent (可移動、進食，需人協助洗澡); She could move herself from bed to chair, but could not walk due to bilateral knee joint pain and contracture. She received regular follow-up at Wanfang hospital CV and Neuro OPD, and Taipei Tzuchi hospital PSY OPD for dementia and hypertension. According to her son, she sometimes held misidentification of a familiar person and persecutory delusions. She usually stayed at home, living with her husband, and receiving home services every weekday.

  She was in usual health status until two weeks prior to this admission. She started to complain of low back pain without having specific falling or trauma events. She became bedridden, and had poorer appetite and less activity. The pain aggravated, so she was brought to Wanfang hospital emergent department twice. The L-spine MRI on 2021/04/12 showed compression fracture at T12, and a 2.4cm mss lesion at L2-3 level. Tumor cannot be ruled out. The surgeon there suggested furthur operation, but the patient's family members refused due to surgical risks. She denied fever, chest pain, abdominal pain, urinary incontinence, stool incontinence or urinary retention. Her upper limbs muscle power was 4+, and her lower limbs was 4. Under the impression of T12 compression fracture and suspected lumbar spinal tumor, she was admitted for furthur management.

[Indication for admission]
嚴重精神病症狀，需急性治療者。
因精神症狀嚴重影響家庭，而必須住院治療者。","PSYC: [Present Illness] 
 This is a 35-year-old woman with no known physical underlying disease. She graduated from 世新大學電影系 (曾因進修規劃休學兩次). After graduate, she once worked in movie industry (自述曾和比爾賈導演一起工作), then worked the administration department of a restaurant company for many years till now(烏魯木魯餐廳集團的行政工作). Her family member include parents and an older brother. According to her mother, her older brother had major depressive disorder. She is now living with her parents in Taipei. Alcohol use of 1-2 cans of beers and 2-3 shots of 高粱 was reported by her for about 1-2 years. Illicit drug use was denied.
 According to her statement, she was first admitted to TCPC in 2010 (23 y/o) due to emotional turmoil at school (在學校大哭). She reported feeling of being controlled by school and being persecuted by some teachers. Hallucination were denied. After admission, Risperdal was prescribed and patient was diagnosed with Schizophrenia.
 The second admission was also in TCPC, in 2013 (26y/o). She was admitted because she went to the house of 比爾賈導演 and said “我愛你” to him. She reported she was being controlled to do so. (有一股力量叫我要去他家、說出這句話) Hallucination was denied. Abilify was prescribed during admission.
 After discharge, she was under regular follow up at TCPC OPD with residual symptom of delusion of being control and some persecutory delusion. (被比爾賈導演、大學老師控制) She could still maintain job with unknown performance. (媽媽說因為餐飲集團老闆在20多歲就認識她, 才有辦法讓她一直做這份工作, 換過多種職位) In recent months, her regimen was increased to Abilify 30mg/day due to increasing delusion. 
 However, she only took 1/5 tabs (3mg). In recent one week, she thought that she was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia for 13 years and she went to TCPC to 調病歷. She thought the content of the medical record were not true, and she went back to ask her OPD doctor on 4/21. She came to our ED alone on
4/23, asking for a judgement about her medical record. She also felt being persecuted by her parents (被父母軟禁) and began to contact teacher in the university hoping to clarify the content of her admission note 13 years ago. The teacher didn't answer her message and she felt being persecuted, so she posted on facebook and sent many SOS message to strangers. She also went to police office
on 4/24 with two friends for acusing 病歷被造假、被大學老師迫害. On 4/24 evening, she was brought to our ED by her mother for the disturbing behavior above and probably affect her job. Psychiatrist was consulted.
 During interview, she was defensive, paranoid and argumentative. Her speech amount and speed were increased. Suspect thought blocking was noted (對話中常常停頓、分心, 自述想法一直被打斷, 需要設很多鬧鐘) She was not agitated in her behavior. Persecutory delusion toward family, TCPC doctor and her university teacher was noted.
 She denied hallucination. We suggested Haldol and Anxicam and ED stay, but she refused. She also refused admission or any oral anti-dopaminergic regent. She only accepted hypnotics and insist to leave. We prescribed Olanzapine 5mg/day and Imovane prn for her symptom and insomnia. NTUH psychiatric OPD on 4/26 was arranged, and she promised to come with her mother. 
 She came back to NTUH OPD on 4/26, 5/4 and 5/17. Abilify 15mg was prescribed on 4/26, and improvement was seen on 5/4. However, on 5/17 OPD, she reported left flank pain with object within her flank (being inserted by others). She frequent called the police for the persecutory delusion about being persecuted. Frequent going outside and disorganized behaviors were noted. Admission was suggested on 5/17 but patient refused. 
 From 5/17 to 6/7, persecutory delusion aggravated (頭上和肚子有被大學李老師裝伺服器, 以前被李老師迫害, 但家屬調查過沒有此事, 被家人軟禁, 松德醫院也跟大學老師串通, 病例都是假的). Accompany with delusional behavior, disorganized speech and disorganized behavior. For example, she frequently went to the hospital(多次就醫請外科醫師開刀取出伺服器、被拒;覺得腦部有被裝機器,多次看神經科,做過MRI檢查,無異狀), and called the police(自述被性侵要報案). She even had self-harm behavior(用力毆打自己的肚子因為覺得那個位置有伺服器) and risky behavior(6/7自行叫救護車去醫院就醫後逃跑,在馬路上奔跑,跑到不見蹤影). On 6/7, she went to 刑警大隊 to 報案, and was rejected. She felt chest discomfort and call 119 to the hospital on 6/7 evening. She was first sent to 松山H. ED. However, she was impatient at 松山H. ED and ran away from the hospital to the road. She took the taxi and came to NTUH ED. Psychiatrist was consulted. Considering acute psychotic episode with persecutory delusion, disorganized behavior, speech, and some self harm and risky behaviors, admission is indicated. She was then admitted to the psychiatry ward on 2023/06/09.

On 10/18 fever up to 38.3'C was noted and septic work-up was done and ID specialist was consulted. ID specialist suggested us to use Ertapenem to replace Ceftazidime because the ertapenem could have synergistic effect with oxacillin for MSSA infection. Her appetitie and spirits were improved slowly. Another fever was noted on 10/21 and it was only 38'C. We contacted ID specialist again and they considered that it was still the part of the course of MSSA infection and advised us to keep current antibiotic regimen.,After admission empirical unasyn was kept with Enterococcus facealis less likely to be VRE after ID consultation. We collect culture and shift to APD on 10/8. If refractory abdominal pain and fever still persisted after antibiotics use for 5 days We consult GS for PD removal and re-implantation scheduled on 10/16 pending consultation letter. Also Abdominal CT on 10/09 showed abdominal wall abscess around the PD catheter compatible with refractory peritonitis with tuneel catheter infection after antibiotics. We shift to vancomycin with ceftazidime with HD initiation on 10/13. Free drain of peritoneal dialysate was perofrmed until PD tube removal.,"MED: Informant:the patient's sister

She had been in her general health status until 2015, when malignant hypertension and rapidly progressive renal failure developed. Renal biopsy on 2016/03/07 confirmed hypertensive renovascular disease. ESRD was diagnosed, and peritoneal dialysis (APD) has been kept since 2016/06. One episode of tunnel infection of Tenhkoff catheter developed in 2016/08, and subsided after empirical antibiotics use. Dislocation of Tenckhoff catheter occured in 2019/04, and partial replacement was performed smoothly on 2019/05/17. PD tube partial replacement was performed again on 2019/11/10 due to poor Tenckhoff catheter function without evident infection.
Disruption of PD tube (extracorporeal portion) was noted since 2023/02/19 with PD held and repair on 2023/02/27. 

This time, she complained abdominal pain over periumbilical region on 10/3 night and fever episodes noted with general weakness and malaise on 10/4. Watery diarrhea with turbid dialysate were noted on 10/4 thereafter. Accompanied with insertion site pain and swelling, she felt decreased appetite since 10/3. The patient visited ED on 2023/10/04, where the initial vital signs were T/P/R:38.8/86/18, BP: 168/89mmHg. SpO2:100% under room air. Uremia, hyponatremia and leukocytosis with left shift were noted (BUN 92.9/Cre 13.5, Na 129, WBC/Seg 9270/94.1%). Sono was arranged with fluid acculumation, r/o peritonitis and tunnel catheter infection. Empirical antibiotics: Tazocin were administered with IP cefazolin and ceftazidime use. Then her fever subsided with dialysate culture persue. Then under the impression of peritonitis with Tenckhoff tunnel catheter infection related, she was damitted for further evaluation and treatment.

At baseline, she is totally independent. 
At baseline, her ADL/iADL was totoally independent(pre-stroke mRS =0). 
She is a housewife and living in 台中 since 2019 after the COVID pandemic. She used to live in Okinawa.

This time, she has last been normally at around 15:30 when she was on the MRT. Suddenly, she had bilaterally tinnitus, followed by generally weakness, dizziness, vertigo and nausea. She then called for help and was sent to our ED at 11/17 15:58. She had vomiting during the ED stay.

At triage, vital signs showed Blood Pressure: 155/78mmHg, Pulse Rate: 73/min, Respiratory Rate: 18/min, Temperature: 36.9℃, SPO2: 95%. NCCT showed suspected left cerebellar recent infarct. I was then consulted for evaluation. The NIHSS at NTUH ED was 2 (000 000 0000 10010). Brain plein CT revealed infarcts in left cerebellum and right upper cerebellum. Aspirin was administered. Later brain MRI showed subacute infarcts in left PICA territory and right upper cerebellum. Aspirin was stopped.

However, pogressive vomiting occurred since 11/17 morning. Drowsiness was also noted (E3M6V4). Neurologist was contacted. NIHSS became 5 (100 100 0000 10020) at 11/18 8PM. Bilateral hypometric saccade, horizontal gaze limitation, more limitation to her left (poor gaze holding) were found. A emergent CT showed left lower cerebellum infarct with edema and compression to vermis, 4*4 cm. Mannitol was administered. She was then admitted to the ICU for further treatment.

We would keep current treatment and pend TRODAT next week.,After admission we kept his medication from OPD initially. We also arranged brain MRI for tremor survey and might adjusted dosage of fluoxetine if no definite brain lesion. As for general edema we added Busix 1# QD.

This is a 70-year-old man with underlying:
1. Hypertension, under Carvedilol, Doxazosin, Valsartan, and Amlodipinen
2. Liver cancer, stage unknown, status post left hepatectomy, under target
therapy, with progression
According to wife, his education level was graduation from junior high school. He
completed mandatory military service smoothly. Afterward, he had worked as a
vendor in the market (在市場賣雞) for 20-30 years, till he retired at age 50. He
used to smoke but had quitted for decades. There was no alcohol use or illicit
drug use history. There was no known family psychiatric history. He had two kids
with his wife, and he currently lived with his wife in Taipei.

His first psychiatric history was about 40 years ago (age 30+), at 台北市仁愛醫院
due to depressive symptoms including pervasive depressed mood, insomnia. Over
the past decades, he had been treated mostly at OPD, with both depressive
episodes and suspected hypomanic episodes. According to wife, depressive episode
included pervasive depressed mood, loss of energy, insomnia, poor appetite,
guilty thinking, and thoughts of death, which mostly lasted for about 3 months.
Symptoms from hypomanic episode included expansive, some grandiosity, talkative,
and indiscretion(會花錢請朋友很多東西; 去辦信用卡等), which lasted for also 3
months under medication. He could still manage work and earn money to raise his
kids most of the time. Over the decades, there was only once hospitalization at
age 30+, due to depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation with self-harm attempts
by wrist slashing, and agitation(比較激動, 大吼大叫). He was hospitalized for
1-2 weeks at an unknown hospital. Otherwise, his condition could be stabilize
under medication at OPD.

He retired 20 years ago (age 50+). According to wife, his depressive episodes and
hypomanic episodes had become more frequent since, with about once
depressive/hypomanic episode every 1-2 years. 3 years ago (age 67), his brother,
who was close to him, died from multiple myeloma, and he had only depressive
episodes since. Also at the same year (age 67, 2019), he was diagnosed with liver
cancer (tumor at left liver), and he received left hepatectomy at 新光醫院. 6
months later, metastasis to right liver was found, and he had been receiving
target therapy at 仁愛醫院 for liver cancer since. He had been depressed more
often than not since then, but could still enjoy some activities (看電視) and
remain iADL independent. He was regularly followed-up at psychiatry clinic of 和
平醫院 under medication mainly including Fluoxetine and Valproic acid.

However, in 2022, due to his intolerable to target therapy (會脫皮), the
dose of target therapy was decreased. During follow-up in 2022/08, progressive
disease (larger size of right liver tumor) was suspected. Since then, his
condition had gradually worsened, with pervasive depressed mood, anhedonia (不再
想看電視), loss of energy (整天躺床或睡覺), insomnia, decreased appetite with
weight loss 5kg in 6 months, guilty thinking (都是自己的錯, 自己拖累家人, 對不起
家人), concentration deficit, psychomotor retardation, and suicidal ideation. The
suicidal ideation had aggravated recently (想要跳樓, 想要讓自己餓死, 想要刺死自
己), with suicidal attempt by trying to stab a knife to his abdomen on 02/05 (被
太太搶走刀子). In addition, there was impairment to his daily function. He became
unable to take bath or manage ADL by himself (會說想洗澡/刷牙也不知道該怎麼洗澡/
刷牙). In addition, there were reported tremor, shuffling gait, and limb edema
recently. According to wife, there were no psychotic symptoms including AH, VH,
or delusions. He returned to psychiatric OPD today, and according to family, he
was then referred from psychiatric OPD to our hospital (家屬述和平醫院醫師說調藥

Clerk note/n1. Management of bipolar depression
Bipolar depression
There are no RCTs of any agents in older adults with acute bipolar depression. Post hoc analyses of RCTs suggest efficacy of quetiapine and lurasidone therapy and hence these are recommended as first-line options. However in older adults given the concerns about side effects of atypical antipsychotics clinicians may wish to try lithium or lamotrigine first based on their efficacy in adult populations although the evidence of efficacy is limited in older adults Divalproex aripiprazole and carbamazepine are third-line options. ECT is an important option that should be considered in treatment-resistant cases for suicidal patients or for patients with inadequate food or fluid intake.

Ref. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bdi.12609

2. 什麼樣的病人不適合使用antidepressants?
Mixed type: 
- DSM-IV Name: Mixed Episode
The criteria are met both for a manic episode and for a major depressive episode (except for duration) nearly every day during at least a 1-week period
- DSM-V Name: Depressive Episode with Mixed Features
Full criteria are met for a depressive episode and at least three of the symptoms of manic or hypomanic episodes are present during the majority of days

3. Valporic acid的劑量該如何調整
Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to ensure the efficacy and safety of VPA. Total VPA serum concentration when measured clinically has a recommended therapeutic range of 50–125 mg/L

# The patient's condition includes both psychiatric and physical components, with ongoing evaluation and management of depressive state, suspected parkinsonism, hyponatremia, and edema.","This week, the patient's mood has shown some improvement, as noted on 02/22, with the patient feeling better and willing to watch TV and take short walks with his wife. By 02/23, he denied suicidal ideation but still expressed feelings of a meaningless life. The patient underwent a brain MRI on 02/21, which revealed no definite organic lesion but showed a small left cavernous ICA aneurysm of little clinical significance. His medication regimen was adjusted, with the addition of Wellbutrin and a plan to taper Fluoxetine. The patient's edema has been managed with Busix, and his psychiatric condition continues to be monitored. On 02/24, the patient's condition was stable, with improved sleep and a willingness to participate in short walks, though he still exhibits some depressive symptoms and occasional small steps in his gait. Overall, the patient's clinical course this week has been marked by gradual improvements in mood and participation in activities, alongside ongoing management of his psychiatric and physical health.",PSYC

The cardiologist suggested single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and consulting the surgeon for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Desaturation under an O2 nasal cannula 5L/min was noticed and we switched to an O2 mask. Sinus arrest about 5-6 seconds was noticed at 11/24 03:00 03:01 03:32. A temporary pacemaker and a central venous catheter were placed. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noticed after the event and amiodarone infusion was started. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm in the morning on 11/24 but abnormal pacing spikes were noticed. The temporary pacemaker was adjusted. We consulted the social worker due to the lack of family support. The cardiologist suggested CABG surgery first and electrophysiological study later. The cardiovascular surgeon suggested discontinuing clopidogrel and arranging CABG surgery on 12/1. Chest CT showed pulmonary edema and mild pleural effusion. Persistent hypertension was noticed after dialysis and nitroglycerin infusion was prescribed.,,"MED: Informant: Patient and previous medical record

She was an ADL-independent woman who lived alone in a sixth-floor apartment. She was diagnosed with coronary artery disease, 3-vessel disease by coronary angiography at Heping hospital in 2018. She didn't pursue further intervention. She started to receive hemodialysis in 2021/03.

She complained of chest tightness, general malaise, and poor appetite since 2023/11/19. There was also exertional dyspnea since 2023/11/20. She denied fever, diaphoresis, upper respiratory symptoms, neck or left shoulder or left arm pain, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She came to Heping hospital on 2023/11/22. She was referred to a pulmonologist. Markedly elevated troponin-T (2787 ng/L) was noticed. Acute coronary syndrome was suspected. Loading doses of aspirin and clopidogrel were prescribed. However, she chose to discharge against medical advice.

She came to NTUH ER on 2023/11/22. At the triage, her consciousness was clear with a Glasgow coma score of E4V5M6. The vital signs showed blood pressure 134/70 mmHg, body temperature 37.6°C, pulse rate 91/min, respiratory rate 24/min, SpO2 90%. EKG showed ST elevation in leads aVR, V1, V2; and ST depression in leads I, II, III, aVF, V5, V6. Physical examination showed bilateral crackles. Laboratory exam showed leukocytosis with predominant neutrophils (WBC 10.93 k/μL, seg 85.6%), anemia (Hb 9.1 g/dL), abnormal liver tests (AST 157 U/L, ALT 120 U/L), and elevated level of cardiac enzymes (troponin-T 3670 ng/L, CK-MB 23.44 ng/mL). Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusion. The tentative diagnoses were acute coronary syndrome and community-acquired pneumonia. The cardiologists were consulted. Heparin, loading dose of aspirin, and Unasyn were prescribed. Echocardiography showed preserved ejection fraction (63.0%) and no regional wall motion abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed stenosis of three coronary arteries. No stent was deployed. The cardiologist suggested single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and consulting the surgeon for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She was admitted to the intensive care unit on 2023/11/23 for further management.

However two episodes of asystole with pulseless (~6sec and ~5sec) each developed at 03:00 and 03:01. Lab data included ABG and cardiac enzyme was obtained. EKG showed still STE over aVR V1 to V4 relative stable compared to previous study.

Episode of asystole with pulseless developed few times again since 03:32 ~6sec each time and return to AfRVR itself. TPM was inserted. CVS specialist was consulted again. CVC was also inserted at LFV.

Aggravated depressive mood and suicidal ideation for 2 months

[Indication for admission]
有自殺危險性，且家人照顧有困難者。
因精神症狀嚴重影響家庭，而必須住院治療者。","PSYC: [Present Illness] 
The 49-year-old woman had a history of scoliosis status post surgery and Meniere's disease. She was introverted in nature, and had no close friend, according to her statement. She claimed to be sexually assaulted when she was 7 years old, but no trauma-related symptoms were noted. She did not graduate from vocational high school due to health issues (scoliosis), and had been a housewife since she got married in her age 27. She lived with her husband, and her only daughter just moved out to Tainan to study in university. There was no known psychiatric family history, and she denied use of alcohol, cigarettes, or illicit drugs. 

She had been in her usual health until 2022/09, when her daughter moved to Tainan to study in 成大. She felt lonely afterwards, and gradually evolved to pervasive depressed mood in the following 1-2 weeks. Anhedonia, decreased appetite (weight loss about 2 kg), psychomotor retardation (sometimes agitation), inattention, hopelessness, helplessness, and suicidal ideation also developed. She would yell in the house even when facing trivial things like eating or going to the toilet. (喊煩煩煩、死死死、精神病*3等) There was no concrete suicidal plan, but she would think of jumping from height or wrist cutting occasionally. She initially went to LMD, and came to Dr簡意玲's clinic on 10/20, where major depressive disorder was diagnosed, and she was prescribed with Brintellix. In the following month, Brintellix was titrated to 2 tabs per day, and Valdoxan was also added (1tab/d). She and the family felt limited improvement, and she was admitted on 2022/11/14 for further management.

  He is a ADL total dependent male. He suffered from shortness of breath for five days. Besides, there was large amount of sputum from his tracheostomy. What's worse, he got fever and his general condition became worse. Therefore, his family took him to our ER for help. 
 At triage, Blood Pressure: 123 / 66mmHg, Pulse Rate: 110/min, Respiratory Rate: 22/min, Temperature: 38.8℃, SPO2: 95％ were noted. His consciousness was E4VTM6. Lab data showed leukocytosis with left shift. CXR showed no significant lesion. Empirical sintrix was given for suspected pneumonia. Clinical condition and lab data got better after our treatments. However, he still had productive cough and his lab data still revealed leukocytosis. Upon evaluation, bilateral basal crackle still noted. Thus, under the impression of pneumonia, he was admitted to our ward for further evaluation.

By 12/17, the patient showed improvement with decreased fever and productive cough, and rehabilitation was continued for deconditioning. On 12/20, the patient's condition was stable, with afebrile status and resolved right lower lobe ronchi. However, the patient's acute on chronic kidney disease (ACKD) worsened, with creatinine levels increasing to 6.2 by 12/21 and 7.4 by 12/23, indicating an intrinsic type of ACKD. Despite the medical team's advice, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice (AMA) on 12/24, after being informed of the potential risks of kidney function deterioration, including electrolyte imbalance, acid-base disturbance, and fluid elimination issues.

He had fair respiratory pattern and statisfying SpO2 level under nasal cannula and nasal airway use. Mepem was continued for Pseudomonas pneumonia. Follow-up chest X-ray showed a stable condition. His creatinine level gradually decreased and reached 0.9 mg/dL on 10/06. Other lab data were also unremarkable. We recorded his I/O and adjusted diuretics accordingly to prevent fluid overload. Loose stool was reported by his caregiver; therefore Clostridium rapid test was checked and showed negative results. However we would keep empirical Metronidazole for one week. We would try nasal airway removal next week and he may be discharged next week after completing 14-day Mepem therapy.,After drug sensitivity test results revealed tazocin-resistant Pseudomonas and Klebsiella on 09/25 the patient's antibiotic regimen was switched to meropenem. For CO2 retention caused by sputum impaction and upper airway obstruction (bulky tongue and poor airway protection) we employed nasal airway (size 7 silicon) and nighttime BiPAP use which successfully lowered the patient's CO2 levels. As of 09/27 the patient's creatinine level has decreased to 1.6 from the previous peak of 2.8. We will complete a full 2-week course of meropenem therapy.,"MED: Informant:The patient and his medical records

The patient is bedridden and completely dependent at baseline. On 2023/08/16, decreased urine output was noted by the family, and the dose of furosemide was increased to 1 tab each day. On 2023/09/07, low-grade fever was noted by the family and the patient was brought to our emergency department. The diagnosis of pneumonia was made and the patient was given empricial cefepime. After defervescence, the patient was discharged on 09/17, and which time his creatinine was elevated at 1.8 (from the baseline of 1.1). After discharge, oral doxymycin treatment was maintained but the patient's body temperature remaiend mildly elevated at 37.X C. In addition, the patient's conscious state changed (previously able to express displeasure through sounds and motioning with arms; unable to do so then). On 2023/09/20 at Dr. Lin's outpatient clinic, leukocytosis (11k) and elevated creatinin (2.5) were found, and the patient was advised to seek emergent care. The patient complied, and vitals at triage were as follows: Consciousness: Drowsy , E: 3, V: 2, M: 5 Vital signs: Blood Pressure: 149/83mmHg, Pulse Rate: 95/min,
Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 37.5℃, SPO2: 99％ room air. Under the impression of acute kidney injury and pneumonia, the patient was given empricial tazocin. The patient is admitted for continued management of acute kidney injury and suspected infection.

After drug sensitivity test results revealed tazocin-resistant Pseudomonas and Klebsiella on 09/25 the patient's antibiotic regimen was switched to meropenem. For CO2 retention caused by sputum impaction and upper airway obstruction (bulky tongue and poor airway protection) we employed nasal airway (size 7 silicon) and nighttime BiPAP use which successfully lowered the patient's CO2 levels. As of 09/27 the patient's creatinine level has decreased to 1.6 from the previous peak of 2.8. We will complete a full 2-week course of meropenem therapy.","2023-10-02

Intensive chest care was also applied. Mild hemosputum was noted and oral transamine and actein were given. Haldol HS was regularly given for sleep. 
  We kept monitoring his respiratory condition and if the condition was stable further home hospice care plan will be discussed with his wife.","After admission we kept Tazocin for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's symptoms gradually improved with smoothly breath pattern over time. For now he is not dyspneic at rest and oxygen demand as well decreased. For impaired renal function follow-up data showed improving creatinine levels(2.9->2.6). However a high body temperature noted on 2/2 morning. According to his wife there was no dyspnea productive cough diarrhea turbid urine or obvious wound. But he had obvious body weight loss in recent 2 months besides pancreatic head carcinoma had been told on 2022/09 without tissue proof. Thus we arranged septic work up first and also had examination of HbA1c and tumor marker. According to lab data and previous image body weight loss was fresh DM and pancreatic head mass related. As for fever favor tumor fever related. Thus anti-pyretic agent was prescribed. We would monitor vital signs and follow up his onetouch data.
During this week we kept antibiotics 10 days for pneumonia and consulted rehabilitation doctor for evaluation of swallow and deconditioning.
 After evaluation and discussion caregiver training and preventing secondary complications such as bed sore joint contracture or immobilization syndrome were arranged. Improve bed mobility easier transfer wheelchair activities preventing aspiration achieve safety swallowing were also suggested. On 2/9 night non-contrast CT was performed for further evaluation of pancreatic mass which showed 1)Lobulated hypodense lesion about 7.6cm in largest dimension at the pancreatic head much enlarged compared with previous MR on 20160307 2)A small left adrenal nodule about 0.6cm 3)Irregular peribronchial consolidation and ground glass opacity at bilateral lungs suspicious of infectious/ inflammatory process. We informed the enlargement of pancreatic head tumor to his wife. Due to decreasing activity and poor consciousness the family preferred hospice care. Thus hospice was consulted and a family meeting was arranged on 2/12 they refused intubation cardiopulmonary resuscitation NG tube insertion. And preferring a better sleep quality for the patient thus SC haldol 5mg HS was given and we discontinued oral and IV form medication. He was than transferred to our hospice ward for further palliative care.","FM: Informant:patient's wife

He was followed at Dr. LT Lee's clinic for his chronic diseases. He had hospitalization on 2022/12/23-2022/12/31 due to community acquired pneumonia, and treated with tazocin. This time, he suffered from progressive dyspnea with desaturation (SpO2<92%). Then he was brought to our emergency department by EMT. According to his wife, he had difficulty to cough up phlegm since last hospitalization and became moving with a wheelchair. There was no recent fever, travel, dysuria, pyuria, diarrhea, tarry stool or bloody stool. At triage, his vital sign was BT:37.7℃ PR:91/min RR:30/min BP: 117 / 43 mmHg, SpO2:96% under non-rebreathing mask 15L. Physical
examination showed bilateral corase breathing sound. The chest X-ray disclosed ill-defined patchy opacities at both lungs, especially bilateral lower lung zones. The blood gas showed metabolic acidosis(pH=7.312, HCO3=17.5) with an elevated lactic acid level(5.01). Lab data showed
leukocytosis with left shift (WBC 8460, seg:94.9 %), acute on chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia. Emperical Tazocin was prescribed for pneumonia and kalimate was also administered for hyperkalemia. His oxygen demand was gradually titrated down and now was simple mask 6L. He was admitted to our ward for further treatment.

臨床心理探視記錄/n[臨床背景]
病人為89歲已婚男性，失智症。病人胰臟有水泡於門診追蹤十數年穩定，然近期電腦斷層顯示腫瘤擴大，疑似胰臟癌。於2022年12月曾因肺炎住院後即依靠輪椅移動，2023/1/29晚上開始呼吸喘，痰多至急診診斷肺炎2/1入6A接受抗生素治療。因疾病進展，家屬簽署DNR，2/16轉入安寧緩和病房照護。

[探視資料]
一、	行為觀察
病人閉眼休息打呼，太太於床邊沙發陪伴。主治醫師探視時，病人醒來，眼神可聚焦，嘴巴有開合，口中念念有詞，但難以辨別，太太告訴病人「是醫師來探視，很多人來看你」，並摸病人的頭。在旁也有看護陪伴照顧，太太表示病人失智多年，在家也多由看護照顧。
二、	晤談紀錄
1.	病人太太聽到實習生自我介紹為臨床心理實習生，便表示「這個狀況都有準備了。」實習生重述，太太詢問哪個狀況，表示很長時間，不知道從何說起：病人失智症1 2年了，請看護7年。病人身體慢慢退化，上次住院就不太能行動。
2.	病人太太表示病人一年來都有譫妄的狀況，會以為還在工作，坐在電腦前面收發email，可能因病人之前的工作是工程師，病人會要女兒去送信，後來發現他電腦電源也慢慢不會開。
3.	病人太太表示病人晚上蠻躁動的，會手腳揮動、拳打腳踢，安眠藥也從原本一顆加到現在吃四顆，還是會只睡一兩小時就醒來。
4.	病人太太表示之前就有發現胰臟的腫塊，但病人會有躁動揮舞手的狀況（可能與失智有關），很難檢查，也因為病人那時年紀七十幾，所以醫師建議定期門診追蹤，大小也維持差不多，是這次住院才發現腫瘤突然變大了。
5.	太太表示有準備，她跟病人的塔位都在幾年前買好了，是因為父母離開後禮儀公司在向他們介紹，也怕女兒會不好處理，要到處奔波。
6.	太太表示上次出院也準備了很多輔具、設備，但沒有用到就又住院了，並表示沒有打算回家，現代人公寓都覺得在醫院走比較好。前幾天醫師說病人可能會在醫院走，但來這邊病房之後又說只能住兩個星期。
7.	太太表示晚上是看護照顧，她會先離開醫院，白天搭車九點左右到醫院。太太自陳這幾天比較有睡。
8.	病人太太表示安寧是女兒建議的。太太自陳已退休二三十年，兩女兒都已婚、搬離家。她們週末會回家，由病人太太煮飯一起吃。

[概念化與處置]
1.	病人對外界的人員接近有一定的反應，會發出一些聲音，口語內容較難辨識，太太會嘗試與病人互動回應。
2.	病人太太觀察病人狀況，覺得病人近來比較躁動，睡眠減少，增加照顧上的難度，有看護協助分工照顧。病人太太可能受病人晚上躁動的狀況影響較難休息，不過病人住院時，太太晚上回家，比較可以有完整時間的休息。
3.	病人太太能說明病人疾病歷程及當前症狀，了解病人的疾病進展，表示病人失智多年，對於病人可能離世有所安排與準備，同理病人太太的感受與照顧負擔，肯定病人太太照顧的用心。家人也都了解病人的病況，希望病人在醫院善終，對於只能住院兩週，若要出院的變動，有不安的心情。

[計畫與建議]
持續關心與評估病人、家屬的調適狀況。

臨床心理探視記錄/n[臨床背景]
病人為89歲已婚男性，失智症。病人胰臟有水泡於門診追蹤十數年穩定，然近期電腦斷層顯示腫瘤擴大，疑似胰臟癌。於2022年12月曾因肺炎住院後即依靠輪椅移動，2023/1/29晚上開始呼吸喘，痰多至急診診斷肺炎2/1入6A接受抗生素治療。因疾病進展，家屬簽署DNR，2/16轉入安寧緩和病房照護。

[探視資料]
一、	行為觀察
病人躺床看向左前方時鐘方向，頻繁發出嘗試咳痰的聲音，左手抖動，身體偶有輕微抖動。臨床心理實習生輕拍叫喚病人、詢問病人狀況，病人皆無明顯動作或反應。實習生移動至病人視線內，叫喚病人、與病人揮手，病人有視線聚焦。在護理師抵達前，病人咳痰聲音趨緩。護理師移動床欄，病人有轉頭看向護理師的反應。
二、	晤談紀錄
1.	太太表示這兩天病人痰比較多，早上洗完澡之後，就一直痰比較多，今天兩三小時就抽一次。
2.	太太進出病房兩次，到護理站找護理師抽痰。第一次回病房表示護理師不在，好像在開會。太太表示看病人這樣咳就難過，且再次離開床邊走到護理站找護理師。
3.	太太表示本次本來就是因為痰的問題入院，在病房症狀有比較好，但這兩天才又變嚴重。主要就還是只能在醫院讓護理師抽痰，之前在家裡真的不知道怎麼處理。
4.	護理師抽痰表示抽出來比較稀，感覺像是口水。建議太太購買減少唾液分泌的貼片使用，太太表示會立刻下去購買。

[概念化與處置]
1.	病人咳痰聲音較頻繁，較少有口語回應，在床有大幅調整的時候偶有眼神聚焦。
2.	病人太太對病人有痰音，感覺較為難受與焦慮，多次主動尋求護理師協助抽痰，也擔心回家照顧會無法協助病人抽痰。

[計畫與建議]
持續關心與評估病人、家屬的調適狀況。

新病人入住討論會/n診斷: 失智症
時間: 2010年
預估存活: 1-2 months

醫師:病人已婚，育有兩女，家庭關係良好。病人過往慢性病於李龍騰醫師門診追蹤，且已失智症多年(2012開始)，胰臟有水泡於章醫師門診追蹤十數年穩定，但於2021後沒有持續追蹤，然而於2022年8月在仁濟醫院做例行健康檢查時，超音波看到胰臟腫瘤約4.4 cm，後續電腦斷層顯示4.8 cm 胰臟腫瘤，
當時李龍騰教授告知為胰臟癌，家屬決定不做治癒性治療(尊重病人五年前說要DNR的決定) 
  近年數次因嗆咳導致肺炎，反覆出入院，病人的意識及身體功能明顯下降，此次因2023年1月29日嗆咳，意識改變至急診，病況一度危急，入住病房後，除了使用抗生素治療後，病人也有瞻妄躁動情緒，因考量病人身體狀況，太太也與女兒討論過後續不要太勉強，以舒適照護為主。後續照會安寧團隊，並入住緩和醫療病房。


主要目標：症狀控制、出院安寧居家銜接

【預估生命期】
■ Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP) = 6 points
■ Interpretation: 30-day survival probability 30-70% 
Palliative Prognostic Index Score (PPI) = 6.5 points
Predicted life span: 1-2 months

【Psychosocial Spiritual Issue】
1.Main caregiver: 老婆
2.Main decision maker: 老婆
3.Awareness: 病人較無法評估，家人知病知末
4.Acceptance: 家人慢性調適
5.Propriety: 已準備
6.Expected death place: 醫院



護理師:
生命徵象穩定 O2 2L可平順呼吸 痰音重且抽出濃稠. 無法進食 皮下點滴水分支持.身體照護可 家屬意向明確 緩和醫療為主

臨床心理實習生：
病人躺床，偶有眼神聚焦，較少口語或肢體回應症狀的詢問，偶而念念有詞但難以辨識。病人失智症進展多年，太太對於病人可能離世有所準備。太太能說明病人疾病歷程與症狀，對於病人有痰的症狀表現較為擔心，也擔心回家會無法處理。病人近年躁動的狀況較為嚴重，較難照顧，太太有看護協助照顧，將持續評估太太的照顧壓力與病人、家屬的調適狀況。

彭仁奎醫師:

姚主任:
一切都要回歸到病人身上 才能跟家屬談. 病人為工程師 五年前已經準備好. 現在談多濃稠 抽也抽不乾淨 不必一有痰音就急於抽痰 徒增痛苦. 從先生的決定及職業引導 讓太太不要聚焦在痰音 而是能做生命回顧",,,"2023-02-08

 He was a heavy smoker (1 PPD for 40 years). According to the patient, he felt breathlessness for about 1 month in 2019/11. He came to FEMH for help and underwent several examinations, which revealed left lower lobe tumor with obstructive pneumonitis. He then decided to came to NTUH for further evaluation and second opinion. At clinics, mild respiratory distress with decreased left breath sound was observed, and chest X ray revealed nearly total collapse of left lung. He was admitted to our ward in 2019/12. Bronchoscopic biopsy was performed and pathology report revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Radiation oncologist was consulted and CCRT was recommended. Chest surgeon was consulted for stent insertion but replied not indicated. Therefore, chemotherapy of Etoposide and cisplatin was prescribed since 12/28. Nausea and
decreased appetite were noted afterwards, and improved gradually. He was discharged on
12/31 and Radiotherpay simulation was done on 2020/01/07. Radiotherapy with 6000cGy/30fr to LLL tumor was performed. The patient received Etoposide(50mg/m2) and Cisplatin(50mg/m2)(C1D1=2020/01/17, C2D1=2020/02/14). Constipation was noted after cycle 2 chemotherapy, laxatives were prescribed. Vomiting was also noted. 2020/02/20 follow-up lab data showed normal hemogram and biochemistry data, day 8 cisplatin was given on 2020/02/21. 
 Follow-up CT on 2020/03/26 and 2020/04/27 showed partial response. However, follow-up CT on 2020/07/31 showed enlarged LLL tumor, left mediastinal, left hilar, and paraaortic lymphadenopathies. Therefore, radiotherapy was performed to LLL tumor and left hilar LAP from 2020/08/26 to 2020/09/16. Bornchoscope guided biopsy was performed on 2020/09/22, and the pathology only showed fibrin clots. Cisplatin + Gemzar was then given as systemic therapy (C1D1=2020/10/16 ~ C4D8=2021/01/15). Follow-up CT on 2020/11/11 showed smaller LLL tumor but new brain and liver metastasis. Therefore, cisplatin + Gemzar was kept, and radiotherapy to left temporal metastasis (2020/12/16 ~ 2020/12/24), and radiotherapy to S4 liver metastasis (2020/12/25 ~ 2021/01/13). Follow-up CT on 2021/02/17 showed enlarged LLL tumor with collapsed
LLL, increased left pleural effusion, and larger S3 liver metastasis. Due to disease progression, chemotherapy with docetaxel was given on C1D1=2021/02/19.

 His chest pain, hemoptysis, and cough progressed more prominently in recent 1 week. His hemoptysis was not abundant. He also reported multiple soreness points at left lower chest, left upper back, bilateral shoulders, and bilateral waist. Therefore, he came to our ED on 2021/02/25. At our triage, vital signs showed: TPR 37.8'C/119/24, BP 109/69, SpO2 98%. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. CXR showed left lung white-out. Lab data showed slightly increased troponin T (44.65 ng/L), but it dropped spontaneously during follow-up (35.37 ng/L). Platelet and coagulation function were normal. Hemoglobin was 8.3 g/dL, but it was stable comparing to previous data. Combivent was given at our ED, but no obvious improvement in dyspnea was noticed after inhalation. Transamin was given for hemoptysis. He was then transferred to our ward for supportive care and further treatment plan.

persisted abdominal dull pain for one day","MED: [Present Illness]
This is a 52-year-old male with underlying diseases of:
#. Chronic pancreatitis, alcoholism related, with recurrent acute exacerbation
#. Pancreatic tumor, a 6.7cm ill-defined complex cystic-solid mass in the head of the pancreas, nature to be determined
#. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
#. Dyslipidemia

He was an ADL independent male who had recurrent acute pancreatitis since 2016. He was admitted at 新北聯合 hospital, 亞東 hospital. Alcohol related pancreatitis was told in other hospital. No biliary stones, autoimmune or pancreatic tumor was told before.

Another episode of abdominal dull pain developed in 2023/02. He came to ER, where elevated lipase was found. Abdomen and pelvis CT on 2023/02/18 showed chronic pancreatitis with dilated P-duct and diffuse atrophy of pancreas parenchyma; a complex cystic-solid mass at the pancreas head, probably a chronic inflammatory change; should beware of malignant transformation. He was discharged from ER after abdominal pain improved. CEA, CA19-9 were within normal limits. Another episode of epigastric dull pain developed the day before ER visit. He took acetaminophen himself. Pain relieved partly. He came to our ER for persisted symptoms. There is no fever, radiation pain, diarrhea, cold sweating, orthopnea. Pain relieved partly when leaning forward. No association with oral intake was reported. Physical examination showed tenderness over epigastric region. Abdomen plain film showed no pneumoperitoneum. Lab data showed elevated lipase. Abdomen echo showed enteropathy, duodenum, bu;b to 3rd portion with gastric outlet obstruction; chronic pancreatitis with dilated MPD and P stone; calcified pseudotumor with pseudocysts, pancreatic head. NPO with IVF was applied. He was admitted for further management.

[Present Illness]   
This 2-day-old male baby, G1P1 GA 38+4 week, was delivered via CS due to prolonged labor at 09:13AM on 2022/08/20 at 禾馨 clinic. The Apgar score was 7(1') to 9(5'). The mother received regular prenatal examination with normal results. Rupture of membrane happened at 13:20, on 2022/08/19. Prophylactic antibiotics with cefazolin was given since 2022/08/18 20:45. The baby was delivered at 09:13AM on 2022/08/20 smoothly. Good activity and fair beathing pattern was recorded after birth.

Initial work up for PROM showed fair hemogram without acidosis or elevated CRP level. Stool passage was noticed after stimulation within 24 hours. However, difficult feeding was noticed around 1-day-old with easy milk regurgitation when he was fed with 10ml Q3H. Distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sound was recorded. Abdominal echo arranged on 2022/08/21 showed rectal dilatation and colonic stasis without signs of obstruction. KUB checked showed dilated bowel. Septic work up done on 08/21 still showed fair WBC and CRP level. The patient was kept NPO with T1 support since 08/21. Follow-up abdominal circumference elevated from 31.5cm to 33cm within one day. Anal tube was inserted on 08/22 morning for decompression, and some menconium was drained out. Empirical antibiotics treatment with Ampicillin and Gentamicin was started since 08/22 for infection could not be rule out.

Since GI obstruction was suspected, we were called for help on 2022/08/22 morining. Our faculty arrived at the clinic bwfore noon. At that time, the baby's vital sign was stable. Physical examination showed distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sound, without tachypnea. The one touch sugar checked again under NPO was 86 mg/dL. At around 12:10pm, the baby arrived at our hospital and was admitted to NICU for further care immediately.","PED: 2d/o, M

According to the patient and the medical record, she had been suffered from intermittent non-productive cough and chest tightness for a year, exacerbated when lying flat. She had seek for medical advise at 和信H. and FEMH due to above reason. She denied chest pain, headache, malaise, change in bowel habit, unintentional weight loss throughout the course. Her chest CT done at FEMH on 2021/05 showed (1) suspected lymphadenopathy in right cardiophrenic recess, subcarinal and bilateral paratrachial regions, left supraclavicular fossa (2) small amount of right pleural effusion with passive atelectasis at dependent site (3) mild uneven pleural thickening along right pleural fissures. Thus, she went to Dr. 黃俊凱's OPD for second opinion. Interstitial lung disease was impressed initially; her cough somewhat resolved with Prednisolone use. Nonetheless, progression of cough was noted since 2 weeks before this admission. Follow up chest X ray at our OPD revealed progression of right pleural effusion. Thoracocentensis yielded 420 ml straw colored effusion, and cytology revealed positive for malignant cells (carcinoma, poorly differentiated, metastatic). Chest echography and cell block cytology was then scheduled, however, the procdure was not performed due to no result of rapid antigen/PCR of COVID-19 within 3 days. Therefore, she was admitted for scheuled endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) first, then malignant effusion work-up including cell block cytology.

The patientwas admitted on 07/15 due to malignant pleural effusion noted at OPD with a past history of breast cancer. Scheuled endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) on 07/15 pm and pleural effusion cell block sent on 07/16 both yielded metastatic breast cancer. Whole body PET on 07/19 revealed multiple metastases at left supraclavicular right lower paratracheal subcarinal and bilateral hilar nodes axial bones and along the right medial pleurae. Intense hypermetabolic spot at left lobe of thyroid was noted suspect goiter or malignancy at left lobe of thyroid. Thyroid echo may be arranged for evaluate the lesion.

Besides moderate amount of pericardial effusion progressed within 2 months was noted on previous CT study (5 mm on 05/07 CT; 15 mm on 07/07 CT). Therefore after consulted chest surgeon surgical PP window was performed on 07/21 for symptom relief. After the operation she was transferred to ICU for close observation.

# The patient has a history of right breast cancer, status post modified radical mastectomy in 2013/08, and was under Tamoxifen treatment.
# Progressive pericardial effusion is present, but the patient is asymptomatic, with a pericardial window procedure performed on 2021/07/21.
# The patient's current condition includes malignant pleural effusion and progressive pericardial effusion, with the pleural effusion suspected to be related to the metastatic breast cancer.","This week, the patient underwent a surgical pericardial window on 07/21 for symptom relief of progressive pericardial effusion. On 07/21, several whitish nodules at the left costophrenic angle and on the diaphragm were found, suspecting carcinomatosis, and 350ml of serosanguineous pericardial effusion was drained. The patient was transferred to the ICU for close observation after the operation and was later transferred to the ward on 07/22. The patient's cough improved, and she had no shortness of breath. Whole body PET on 07/19 revealed multiple metastases, and thyroid echo may be arranged to evaluate the intense hypermetabolic spot at the left lobe of the thyroid. The patient will be followed up by an oncologist for further management of metastatic breast cancer.",MED

Fever developed on 4/1 with chills and empirical Targocid was prescribed. CVC was also exchanged. Albumin and stress dose solu-cortef was also prescribed for fluctuating BP. Blood culture yielded CRBSI candidema and Eraxis was prescribed since 4/2. Fever gradually subsided. However paroxysmal AfRVR was noted on 4/5 and Ciproxin was prescribed for CRPA and SM from the sputum culture. Progressive AKI and elevated liver enzyme was noted. We contacted nephrologist on 4/7 and infection related with mild hypovolemia were suspected the cause while recovery may take for about one week. Hemodialysis was also discussed and the patient and the family agreed.

Free water was given since 4/10 however CXR revealed diffuse bilateral consolidation patches along with lung edema. Therefore after discussion with ID specialist Zerbaxa was prescribed on 4/11 for previous CRPsA coverage while foley and CVC were also exchanged. Intermittent bile content was noted during sputum suction and microaspiration was suspected. His renal function had little improvement and sodium bicarbonate was prescribed again for metabolic acidosis. We consulted PM/R doctor for chest care and rehabilitation on 4/14. However fluctuating condition still occurred while metabolic acidosis remained. Diflucan and Amphotericin B bladder irrigation were initated since 4/19 due to C. glabrata from the urine culture and after discussion with the ID specialist. Nevertheless recurrent fever was still noted. CVC was then exchange on 4/21 due to poor function.","2023-04-21

SUGGESTION: 1. For work up:
# Try to stop irrigation if no indication, record urine osmo and urine amount after hold irrigation
- Check U/A(腎研), UPCR, blood osmo, urine osmo
- Check renal echo to avoid obstruction

2. For treatment:
- Adequate hydration first (consider add free water) to keep I/O balance
- Consider to try DDAVP 1-2ug first and then check urine osmo after 2 hours
@if urine omso increased >50%, suspect CDI
@if urine osmo increased < 10%, suspect NDI
- May try 1-2 ug BID first and close monitor U/O and sodium level (may Q6H check and avoid decreased > 8-10 mEq/day)
- Consider dialysis (CRRT prefered for hypernatremia) if severe uremic symptoms

sudden onset of slurred speech for a day","SURG: [Present Illness]
 This 24-year-old male, who had underlying of asthma and mitral valve regurgitation, was admitted via our emergency department due to sudden onset of slurred speech for a day.
 According to the statment of his mother, he had experienced fever and upper respiratory symptoms for days. Intermittent symptoms were still noticed after medication. However, he suffered sudden onset of slurred speech since yesterday. However, there was no convulsion, headache, nausa, vomiting, blurred vision, or neck stiffness. Aforementioned, he was sent to our ER immediately, where neurologic exam showed dysarthria with Gerstman syndrome, without other specific neurological deficit. Brain CT showed intracerebral hemorrhage at left temporo-parietal lobe. For etiology survey, CT angiography showed suspicion of ruptured left distal MCA pseudoaneurysm. With detailed information, ICU hospitalization was indicated and recommended.
 Therefore, under the impression of spontaneous lobar ICH at left temporo-parietal lobe, he was admitted for close surveillance and etiolgoy management.

Otolaryngologist was consulted for hoarseness after nerve block in 2021/12 and showed no vocal cord palsy. Fever up to 38'C without chills or other subjective discomforts was noted on 01/25. Lab data showd leukocytosis (19.15 k) and elevated CRP(4.09 mg/dL). Empirical Tazocin was added and discontinued on 01/27 due to no infection signs.

 Pain control was uptitrated gradually with Fentanyl 37.5mcg/hr #1 Q3D + OxyContin #3 Q12H + Oxynorm #3 Q4HPRN on 01/27. He reported baseline VAS around 4-5 and breakthrough VAS around 9-10 under aforementioned regimen. On 01/27 bloody stool for 2 times were noted. Hemorrhoid-related bloody stool was suspected. Discharge will be held until bloody stool resolved.","After admission persistent resting pain (pain score:6) over whole body was reported by the patient. 
 Physical examination revealed a 5-cm-sized swelling tender mass with local heat over right shoulder 5-cm-sized tender mass over LLQ bilateral crackles over basal lungs and a grade 1 bedsore over sacrum. No dragging pain over bilateral hip joints was observed. 
 Lab data on 01/19 revealed mild leukocytosis(WBC=18.58 Seg=88.3) and ongoing imflammation of swelling tender mass over right shoulder was suspected. 

 To relieve his persistent resting pain Oxycontin was titrated to 2tab Q8H as basal dose and morphine 5mg IV Q4HPRN was prescribed as rescue dose. There was no episode of breakthrough pain reported under current analgesic set.

 Current status prognosis plan nature of treatment and toxicities were explained well to the patient and his wife so chemotherapy (Trabectedin) was initiated on 2022/01/20. Since chemotherapy starting 2 episodes of stinging feeling over bilateral abdomen were reported. Mild redness around bilateral cheeks was also noticed. No other discomfort was reported.

 FM was consulted for evaluation of hospice care on 01/20 and ENT will be consulted for evaluation of post nerve blockade hoarseness.
HBV HCV antibody titer and other liver enzyme profile will be checked on 2022/01/24.

 Initially, left upper back soft tissue tumor(8.0cm x 10.0cm) was noted in 2017. Therefore, he came to 台北榮總 for help. Needle biopsy on 2017/01/05 and incision biopsy on 2017/01/20 both reported spindle cell tumor. Wide excision with safe margin 2cm + STSG was performed on 2017/02/10. After surgery, the patient had received regular follow-up at 台北榮總 during 2017/02~ 2020/02. 

 A 16mm nodule was reported at RLL by Chest CT on 2020/02/12. Coughing was noticed by his wife since 2020/09. Therefore, he was sent from the USA back to Taiwan for further evaluation. Chest CT on 2021/01/06 showed multiple RLL masses, up to 41mm, with right lower brochus invasion and partial atelectasis. Bronchoscopic biopsy (RLL) on 2021/01/12 revealed metastatic sarcoma. Thoracoscopic RLL lobectomy with diaphragm resection and repair were performed on 2021/02/01. Clinical trial with Levatinib + Halaven was prescribed from 2021/03/17 to 2021/07/07. 

 However, chest CT on 2021/07/08 reported at least three small nodules at RUL, up to 
7 mm in size. Abdomen CT on 2021/07/08 showed a 112mm expansile heterogeneously enhanced mass located at right iliac bone. Whole body PET on 2021/07/20 revealed multiple focal increased uptake in right iliac bon, right buttock, right shoulder, right supraclavicular region, lung, right axillary region, back, left femur, pelvis, and peritoneum. MRI on 2021/07/28 also reported multiple bone and soft tissue lesions over right iliac bone, right sacrum, left proximal femur, left anterior pevic cavit, right spina erector muscle and L4 spinal process. To evaluate rapid progression of suspected metastsis at right shoulder, MRI on 2021/08/04 reported a 31*40*34mm lobulated mass at right distal clavicle and deltoid muscle, with central necrosis and subcutaneous tissue invasion. Therefore, right distal calvical liposarcoma excision was performed on 2021/08/09. Also, palliative RT was given to the large right iliac metastasis during 2021/08/04 to 2021/08/18 (3000cGy/10 fractions). 

 Follow-up chest and abdomen CT on 2021/10/20 showed persistent lymphadenopathy at right axilla, lung nodules with interval progression in size and number, osteolytic change at right clavicle and scapula, bone metastasis and intra-peritoneal metastasis. Left proximal femur liposarcoma excision with bipolar hemiarthroplasty was performed on 2021/11/01. After the surgery, the patient became ADL partially dependent. He could only tolerated walking from bed to bathroom for urination and defecation, and was bedridden or wheelchair-bound at most of the time. Progressive right shoulder pain was noted in 2021/12. Therefore, he received nerve blockade over right shoulder for pain control. Due to rapid progression of recurrent metastasis over right shoulder for 5 months with all therapy in vain, the patient was referred to Dr.陳偉武's OPD on 2022/01/07 for further treatment. Fentanyl Transdermal Patch was prescribed at OPD but the pain persisted. Under impression of pleomorphic liposarcoma with right shoulder recurrence, the patient was admitted to 5W2 for scheduled chemotherapy (Trabectedin, D1=2022/01/20) and pain control.

病人於2017年診斷脂肪肉瘤接受手術治療，於2021年復發且多處轉移，在北榮經過手術及化放療，疾病仍持續進展，故至本院尋求第二意見；此次住院接受腫瘤治療，因疾病末期，原團隊同時照會安寧共同照顧。

今日團隊訪視，病人意識清醒，臥床休息，案妻陪伴在側。團隊關心不適症狀，主訴雙側骨盆腔抽痛，移動時疼痛加劇，沒有服用止痛藥前更痛。病人描述腫瘤治療過程，去年接受骨轉移手術後體力明顯下降，已經回不去了；像這樣只能躺著，沒辦法自理生活的日子太痛苦，更拖累家人；醫師問我是不是有自殺念頭? 我確實有，但是我不會這麼做，我知道這樣做，我的家人會有遺憾；她們希望我繼續努力，可是我已經想很久了，像這個樣子的生活真的沒有必要，心裡真的很孤單，沒有人懂。病人看著太太，告訴太太這是自然的過程，我已經很滿足了，真的沒有關係。案妻向共照護理師表示如果治療只有10%機會，自己會選擇看那10%的機會，不會去看那90%；除非陳醫師認為治療效果不好，倘若是這樣再來考慮後面的事。團隊傾聽、同理病人覺得生不如死，不想拖累家人的感受，也同理案妻不想錯過任何機會。向病人及案妻說明團隊會先協助症狀及舒適照顧，也會將病人、家屬的想法轉達給原醫療團隊，病人可理解接受。

與案妻會談，案妻表示理解先生受苦，不想拖累家人的念頭，但是除非陳醫師認為不行，不然自己還是希望能努力看看。其實之前就曾經看過陳偉武醫師(for 2nd opinion)，當時病人希望專心在北榮治療就好，現在回想起來要是自己能堅持帶病摘來給陳醫師看就好了...。除此之外，過去一家人在美國定居(一月份小女兒返台，二月份大女兒返台)，兩個女兒要是聽到先生有這樣的念頭一定無法接受，所以我已經事先告訴她們，就先順著爸爸。同理案妻不捨情緒，肯定案妻預先主動與女兒溝通；建議好的、不好的準備都要有，鼓勵安排親人陪伴，完成未竟之事等。案妻可理解。病人與太太為基督徒，病人去年受洗，團隊將請牧師關懷。

Stable sputum amount but increased stickiness and white-to-yellow color was noted. Considering the increasing CRP levels and progression of the RLL opacification on the CXR empirical Targocid was prescribed on 8/19 (previous S/C: MRSA with recent sputum smear of GPC in clusters). If fever developed septic work-up would be done and cefepime would be added to cover Pseudomonas.,"Cefepime and Targocid were discontinued on 8/9 and the patient was now antibiotics-free. His sputum amount remained stable and WBC/CRP level were within normal limits. We will keep monitoring his respiratory condition.

VS Note/nAssessment
1. An 86-year-old man with Parkinson's disease with dementia ischemic stroke HTN hyperlipidemia and GERD.
2. He was admitted for aspiration pneumonia with respiratory failure s/p ETT and MV extubation on 4/7.
2. Meanwhile abnormal liver function suspicion of levofloxacin-related hepatotoxicity developed and slowly improved after the discontinuation of levofloxacin.
3. He was transferred to the general ward on 4/9 and meropenem was discontinued after his condition improved.
4. His spirit and hyponatremia improved. A rehabilitation program was initiated.
5. A fever developed probably due to pneumonia and UTI later s/p cefepime and his urinary catheter was removed. His condition improved while intermittent urinary catheterization (IUC) was indicated.
6. His condition improved after cefepime and ampicillin combinations. Meanwhile Harnalidge was added and his voiding amount improved. 
7. Follow-up ECG showed global hypokinesia; thus fluid and salt restriction was implemented with diuretics.
8. After Abx was switched to HD ampicillin-sulbactam low-grade fevers developed with fluid overload. Thus cefepime and ampicillin combinations were resumed.
9. CT of the chest showed infectious/inflammatory change such as pneumonia at both upper lobes partial atelectasis at dependent portion of both lungs probably due to pleural effusion and cardiomegaly. Meanwhile CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed an atrophic pancreas with mild dilatation of MPD and a hypodense mass (5.5cm) at the left pelvic cavity.
10. Delirium low-grade fever increased sputum amount low urine output and elevated inflammation markers were all suggestive of new infection due to pneumonia. 
11. Thus antibiotics were switched to imipenem on 5/17. His conditions improved accordingly while repeated microbiological workup was all insignificant including sputum AFS and SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR. Sputum TB PCR was pending.
12. His inflammation markers and urine output improved under imipenem. 
13. Foley was removed on 5/28 but failed.
14. Imipenem was discontinued on 6/1 after 14-day use and saliva aspiration developed in the afternoon on 6/1 and he had general weakness with decreased spirit in the following days days after the event. 
15. Tazocin was added empirically on 6/1 for his UTI his condition improved but CRP level increased significantly from 0.41 on 6/1 to 13.47 on 6/4 under Tazocin. 
16. Sputum smear on 2021/6/1 showed PMN >25 Epi 1-9 Gram (+) rods 1+ but S/C on 6/1 yielded MRSA and CXR on 6/4 showed increased infiltration on LUL and LLL s/p teicoplanin. 
17. His condition became stable under Tazocin for pneumonia and teicoplanin for his pneumonoia (S/C of MRSA) and UTI (U/C of VS Enterococcus). 
18. ABx were discontinued after 14-day use. 
19. Aldocton was discontinued due to an elevated K level. 
20. Diovan was added for his heart but his SBP dropped to 90-100 mmHg so it was withhold.
21. Fever up to 38.4C developed on 7/4 and UTI caused by ECC was diagnosed s/p cefepime. 
22. His condition got stable but GI bleeding developed s/p H2-blocker.
23. Hypernatremia resolved after the discontinuation of sodium diet supplement. 
24. Declining Hb levels were noted in mid-July with positive OB in his gastric juice and his azotemia also increased with worsening renal function.
25. Bedside renal echo showed collapsed IVC so hydration was given. 
26. CXR showed newly-developed consolidation in LUL without dyspnea and Lab data showed an increased CRP level. His sputum also increased and became thick. 
27. The dose of Madopar was increased due to decreased facial expression and rigidities and his symptoms improved mildly without changes in his verbal output. 
28. His renal function improved after hydration but his heart function was compromised with increasing pro-BNP levels. 
29. His Hb level dropped to 6-7 mg/dL so blood transfusion with washed PRBC was given in the morning on 7/31 and no allergic reactions were observed.
30. His weight increased slowly to 51.5kg on 7/31 and her Cr levels improved gradually but pulmonary edema was noted in her CXR. 
31. His elevated CRP levels and amount of sticky sputum after empirical teicoplanin for sputum smear of PGC in clusters on 7/27. 
32. His responses to conversation improved after blood transfusion and Hb levels increased after iron supplement. 
33. ABx was discontinued on 8/9 after treatment for UTI and pneumonia was completed and his condition remained stable.

She kept follow-up at our CV clinic for PSVT and psychiatric clinic for depression and insomnia. She had admitted to 6A in 2020 due to generalized weakness, bilateral hands kinetic tremor, facial tremor and slowness. Progressie Parkinson disease was suspected and Madopar was uptitrated. She was then followed up at Tri-Service General Hospital for Parkinson disease without medication titration recently. She had admitted to our psychiatric ward in 2021/7 due to delusion(覺得丈夫與外勞有染 所以把自己和丈夫鎖在房間8~12小時), suicidal ideation. 

 In recent 3 months, she complained about generalized weakness, dyspnea, lightheadedness, frequent falling down and bilateral fingers numbness. She was brought to family medicine Dr.黃獻樑's for help and admitted for comprehensive geriatric assessment was arranged. She usually fell down at night when walking to the bathroom. Her appetite was fair and no body weight loss was noted. She denied fever, chills, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory symptoms, abdominal discomfort and skin wound. Her daughter denied any delusion or self harm ideation of the patient recently. Lab data showed no anemia or leukocytosis.

A lumbosacral spine exam on 03/02 showed a compression fracture at L4, and a brain CT on 03/02 was negative for intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's medication regimen includes Fluitran, Sigmart, plavix, Cymbalta, Seroquel, Valdoxan, Herbesser, Livalo, Madopar, and Aricept. On 03/03, lab data showed a total cholesterol level of 143 mg/dL, triglycerides of 75 mg/dL, LDL of 60 mg/dL, HDL of 66 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1c of 5.2%. The patient's diet was assessed, and it was recommended to maintain current dietary habits, increase fluid intake, and encourage physical activity if possible. A comprehensive geriatric assessment was arranged, and the patient's sleep quality and depression treatment were planned to be improved.",FM

# Dyslipidemia",2022-10-07 16:33:00,After admission the patient completed her antiviral treatment at local medical doctor with paxlovid (09/30~10/04). Unasyn was given empirically for possible skin and soft tissue infection presented as the newly-developed bulging mass at left forehead and left preauricular region. However due to her high LDH level during admission exam progression of lymphoma had to be ruled out as well. Hence we consulted dermatologist for the possibility to conduct skin biopsy and culture for further survey. After discussion we decided to observe the lesions for an extra couple of days before biopsy. Whole-body CT for tumor evaluation was also arranged on 10/05 which was eventually only significant for a tiny nonspecific lung nodules fatty liver and uterine myoma. Neither parotid pathology nor lymphadenopathies was reported. Some pustular formation emerged on bilateral arms and we sent the pus discharge for bacterial culture. Both bulging masses on the face became less bulging less erythematous less solid less painful and non-pruritic. We would keep unasyn use and monitor any infection signs or potential neutropenic febrile episode.,,"MED: Informant:patient herself and EMR
Dysgeusia since 09/29","MED: [Present illness]
  This is a 58-year-old female with past medical history of:
# Follicular lymphoma, grade 3A, Ann Arbor stage III, FLIPI score: 1, status post Rituximab and Bendamustine(C1D0=2022/01/14, C2D1=2022/02/09, C3D1= 2022/03/22, C4D1=2022/05/03, C5D1=2022/06/20, C6D1=2022/07/25)
# Dyslipidemia 
Her ADL is totally indepenent, without any catheters indwelled.

This time, based on patient's statement, she was presented with dysgeusia since 09/29, associated with anorexia, headache, increased sputum production, right-sided chest pain on respiration, general malaise. Food and drink has been bitterly tasted since then, and thus poor oral intake ensued. Fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, dysuria were all denied. She then tested SARS-CoV-2 home antigen by herself, which eventually revealed positive result. In addition, on the same day, her daughter was diagnosed with COVID-19 as well. Thus, she visited virtual clinic of local medical doctor on 09/30. Paxlovid for 5 days was then prescribed with medications for symptomatic relief. Upper respiratory tract symptoms slightly improved but productive cough started to emerge. On 10/02, a slightly erythematous lump was noted on left forehead. The lump was pruritic and painful when palpated. Meanwhile, cutaneous side effect of chemotherapy worsened, with flare-up of pruritic erythematous punctate lesions with erosions mainly on bilateral upper limbs and face. All symptoms persisted, while a pruritic, painful, slightly erythematous bulging mass emerged near left preauricular region as well on 10/03. Since discomfort persisted, she contacted her cancer case manager for help. Hospitalization was suggested by her primary Dr.Yao for further evaluation. Hence, this time, with COVID-19, mild disease, and suspected skin and soft tissue infection being focused, she was admitted to our isolation ward for further management.

This is a 48-year-old man who reported no underlying disease. He was ADL totally independent before and lived with his girl friend.

According to the family, the patient suffered from dizziness and intermittent chest tightness for about one week. The chest tightness would radiate to the left shoulder. Besides near syncope episode was reported for several times. However, the patient didnot search for medical help.

This time, sudden collapse was noted at around 13:05 in a convenient store. According to the clerk, there was involuntary movement before the event. Seizure attack was impressed so no bystander CPR was performed. EMT staff was informed at 13:15 and they arrived at 13:31. CPCR was initiated. The initial rhythm was shockable. DC shock was performed for 8 times. The patient arrived our ED at 13:42. The rhythm was PEA. CVS was consulted and ECMO was applied. The flow was set up at 14:09. Followed ECG showed anterolateral STEMI. Emergent coronary angiography was performed and revealed left main and 1 vessel disease. PCI with DES*2 was done smoothly. He was then sent to CCU for further management.

- 5/24 妹妹表示希望轉院到慈濟for高壓氧治療，妹妹表示問新店慈濟神內周儲蔭醫師表示目前病歷中沒看到須收治需求，也未給予明確可收治時間。
- 5/25 告知同時有護理之家及高壓氧的醫院也可以問萬芳（趙醫師提供資訊）。詢問機構找尋有無困難及提醒機構仍需有轉銜前抽血驗大便等檢查需要做，要同時詢問，妹妹表示有在詢問三間機構。
- 5/26 弟弟和媽媽都表示要問妹妹後續照顧規劃。電聯妹妹表示萬芳、雙核、耕莘的護理之家目前都要安排200多號，表示雖然慈濟的高壓氧必須坐立病人現階段不適合，仍希望進行中醫療法等並希望本院安排轉院到慈濟。出院規劃小組表示轉院須問轉銜中心但有機構尋找困難可協助。詢問轉銜中心表示若無住院需求則無轉院管道，機構尋找困難可協助。妹妹表示無法接受並表示下星期要交給弟弟跟媽媽處理後續事項。後續電聯及請看護line未接，已傳line訊息及簡訊表示主治醫師星期日12:00及星期一16:00會跟家屬一起討論。

今電聯慈濟鄒醫師並讓他從電話跟妹妹溝通，確定若現階段無住院需求，仍用轉院方式過去慈濟，鄒醫師無法幫忙。但若先出院回家或到護理之家後，發生任何抽搐、意識變差等症狀，有醫療需求，可以送去台北慈濟急診，他屆時樂於且可協助收治。
然妹妹仍要求本院出具轉診單協助轉院到台北慈濟，到急診看有無科部可以進行評估收治。經團隊討論後，雖家屬希望接受的治療（高壓氧、中醫等）並非科學實證對缺氧性腦病變有效（經神經科醫師評估過現階段缺氧性腦病變無其他有效治療，且高壓氧並非對缺氧性腦病變之常規醫療。且現行高壓氧都無健保給付、需要自費。）且本院現無法提供家屬所希望之治療：
高壓氧：經趙醫師評估，本院只有單人艙，且本院對於缺氧性腦病變的案例數不多。因病人臥床且無法表達，單人艙進行治療若有發生緊急狀況，單人艙內無法有陪同護理師且無法馬上開艙做處置，對此病人風險大。雖此病人無做高壓氧之禁忌症，但好處未知，且於本院施作已知風險多於可能的益處。因此就病人安全考量，本院無法提供此選項，若家屬仍想嘗試建議到他院進行多人艙之治療為較佳選擇。
中醫：本院無中醫。
因此同意就家屬想要尋求第二意見的原因轉診至慈濟（有設置中醫及高壓氧）再評估缺氧性腦病變治療。
然而提供家屬此選項時，家屬表示目前希望先不要轉至慈濟，表示有聯繫到「大腦與意識研究中心」的相關人員，於6/1-6/2會跟教授進行面談，希望本院讓病人再多住。團隊討論後，告知因目前無住院需求，原預計5/31出院，因應妹妹要求需6/1-2要面談，告知6/3為預定出院日。且社工也同時協助尋找護理之家，屆時可先出院至護理之家進行後續長期照護。妹妹表示護理之家屆時也不一定找得到，團隊表示所以社工也會同時幫忙，且家屬也配合尋找（5/17轉出加護病房當日就以給予機構資訊提醒要提前聯繫尋找護理之家做長期照顧準備）。

社工紀錄/n1.大乘菩提心會已評估補助病家25000元急難救助金，協助病人短期照護所需。
2.經通報轉介後，中和社福中心林社工師已來院訪視，將會共同評估協助病人出院安置費用，目前待病家評估是否要轉到台北慈濟醫院繼續治療或於本院出院後直接轉安置照顧。
3.病人未滿65歲，屬可工作人口，但病人目前病情經醫師評估仍需觀察一段時間才能評估失能狀況做身障鑑定，故無法以身障證明作為喪失工作能力的依據，請醫師評估是否能開立""長時間無工作能力""的診斷書，以讓病人可取得低收入戶身分進而可申請安置照顧費用補助，減輕病家經濟負擔。
4.持續補助病人住院期間全日班看護費用。
5.病人母親及妹妹對於病人的病況感到無助及憂心，給予情緒支持鼓勵。

 1. 家屬: 要求錄音
  陳盈憲:同意

 2. 家屬: 心臟內科無法醫治腦部、台大醫院無法提供高壓氧沒有中醫所以屬
     設備不足，有義務協助轉院。
  陳盈憲: 臺大醫院沒有中醫，神內不建議高壓氧，轉院事宜需確認慈濟醫
      院鄒儲蔭醫師之臨床判斷確認是否有轉院需求。

 3. 家屬:衛服部網路公告 電子轉診系統，院方應該利用這個系統，而不是讓
     家屬四處奔波。
  陳盈憲: 現行醫療未使用電子轉診系統

 4. 家屬: 請開利轉診單，讓病患轉診至新店慈濟
  陳盈憲: 將於星期一直接電話聯絡慈濟醫院 鄒儲蔭醫師，確認其臨床判斷

 5. 家屬: 3-6月後才能腦部損傷失能鑑定，是否是3個月後就可以
  陳盈憲: 鑑定部分由神經內科處理，待後續追蹤，由神經內科判斷
  翁榆婷: 即便之後至機構，也可以請機構與合作之醫院醫師處理開立

 6. 陳盈憲: 目前病況已穩定，需同時考慮出院規劃，即便未來轉院至慈濟醫
      院，還是有出院至護理之家需要。
  家屬: 現在重要的是協助轉院
     現在肛門口還有疑似出血物質
     現在還不能出院至護理之家
     護理之家完全沒床，等候序號好幾百號，無法出院

Family contact/n09:57 電聯慈濟神內鄒醫師，表示並未答應予以直接轉院，是建議可以出院回家或是去機構，如果有發現意識變差、抽搐等狀況，送去急診的話他很樂意幫忙。表示家屬希望中醫治療等並不能作為轉診的理由。

10:56 電聯妹妹謝明如
告知：跟鄒醫師電聯後，表示並無答應用轉診方式過去，現無住院需求，但若回家或是去護理之家後，有任何發現抽搐、意識變差、中風等狀況可到慈濟急診，鄒醫師屆時可幫忙。
妹妹謝明如：沒關係我明天再去找鄒醫師。
告知：同時，我們醫院這邊在長期照顧部分可以幫忙協助找尋護理之家。
詢問有無問題時，妹妹掛電話。

＝＝＝
經護長跟社工溝通，社工表示可以幫忙找護理之家。

告知床邊媽媽社工會協助找護理之家，現無住院需求，若有找到可以先到護理之家。慈濟鄒醫師表示若後續有發現抽搐、意識變差、中風等問題，可到慈濟急診，鄒醫師屆時可以幫忙。
媽媽表示，不可能回家，跟弟弟妹妹討論過那天為什麼還要救，一走了之不是比較好，現在變這樣。
護理之家安排部分，希望我們跟妹妹討論。

12:19 電聯妹妹謝明如告知社工會協助找護理之家，現無住院需求，若有找到可以先到護理之家。慈濟鄒醫師表示若後續有發現抽搐、意識變差、中風等問題，可到慈濟急診，鄒醫師屆時可以幫忙收治住院治療。妹妹表示腦波報告有寫抽搐。予以解釋腦波報告「狀況」那一欄是神經科套餐，不是指病人有抽搐，目前臨床未觀察到抽搐，報告中也無癲癇波。
妹妹謝明如：那從住院中到現在神經科做了什麼？高壓氧一開始說可以後來不行......醫院可以幫我們做什麼？
告知：神經科看過表示繼續後續復健、及長期照顧，可無可做治療。高壓氧經過趙醫師評估因為病人安全問題不適合做。醫院可以幫忙找尋長期照顧機構。
妹妹謝明如：為什麼要你們開出一張轉診單那麼困難？鄒醫師都同意可以轉診過去。
告知：早上跟鄒醫師確認過，因為目前無住院適應症，因此無法用住院中轉診方式。後續無論是回家或是去機構，有遇到抽搐等症狀，他都很樂意幫忙。
妹妹謝明如：那邊社工說那邊只要你們開出一張轉診單就可以轉診過去。為什麼不能轉過去急診，再給他評估能不能收住院。
告知：這部分跟鄒醫師確認過...
妹妹謝明如又掛電話。

1. 已跟家屬說明跟鄒醫師詢問後的答覆，但家屬呈不信任，反覆要求協助轉院。
2.本院社工將協助尋找護理之家

Off service/nAfter admitted to CCU SAPT as Plavix (due to hematuria and UGIB) ETT+MV VA-ECMO IABP with heparinization and hypothermia were kept. Norepinephrine was tapered off soon. However the patient still remained comatose under deep sedation as the hypothermia protocol. Unasyn was added empirically for leucocytosis with left shift suspect stress related or aspiration pneumonia. Left reperfusion catheter insertion via LSFA was performed for mild ischemia noted over left leg after transferred back from the cath room.

Rewarming was completed on 2023/5/7 6AM. Tachycardia shivering and fever were noticed sepsis was suspected. Unasyn was escalated to Tazocin empirically. VA-ECMO and IABP were removed on 2023/5/8 and 5/9 respectively after the spontaneous pulse pressure could reach more than 40 mmHg. Day 3 brain perfusion CT and EEG on 2023/5/9 showed hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. Poor neurological outcome was informed thereafter. The consciousness under no sedation was E4M4 at that time. Day 7 EEG on 2023/5/12 still showed severe diffuse cortical dysfunction. Extubation was performed smoothly on 2023/5/14. Plastic surgeon was consulted for the evaluation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy but the patient was relatively contraindicated due to poor LVEF. Under a relatively stationary condition he was transferred to cardiology ward for further care and discharge planning.

Information for longterm facility was given to the sister on 5/17. Social worker also helped for searching nursing home. Transient gastrointestinal bleeding was noted and Aspirin was transiently held since 5/18 and resumed on 5/25 after no bloody stool with stationary Hb. Neurologist was consulted and poor neurological outcome was informed to the family. However the family still hope to receive HBOT. Home care skills was taught but the families (sister brother mother girlfriend) was reluctant to learn. Echocardiography on 5/18 and showed LVEF 70.4 %. After contacting Dr.趙 for hyperbaric oxygen therapy there was no contraindication for HBOT but benefit was unknown and he informed the family(妹妹) to consider 全艙 at other hospital for safety concern (NTUH only has單人艙). As for thrombocytosis after consulting hematologist reactive thrombocytosis was more favored. The patient resumed NG diet with good digestion and stationary BW. Family meeting was held on 5/28 and we informed the family including the patient's mother brother younger sister's boyfriend about current stable condition and the patient could be discharged. However the family refused and insisted that he should be transferred to 慈濟hospital for further care such as Chinese medication and said that they visited 慈濟Neurologist Dr.鄒 and he promised to admit the patient. After contacting Dr.鄒 on 5/29 he confirmed that no transferral was promised or indicated for now. He suggested the patient discharged home or nursing home and promised if there was any seizure like movement decreased consciousness or other indication for admission the patient could be sent to their ED and he'd like to help then. The family still want to be transferred to 慈濟 for the family's request for second opinion for HIE management. However when informing the sister that he could be transferred to 慈濟ED on 5/30. She refused and want to try another treatment (大腦與意識研究中心) and said that she have to have a meeting with associated personale on 6/1-6/2. On 5/29 we informed the sister that he would be discharged on 6/3 after her appointment with the center under stable condition.

He was currently E3-4V1M3-4 free of antibiotics with smooth digestion and brownish stool passage without mechanical or respiratory support. His muscle power especially right side gradually improved (RU/LU/RL/LL 3/1/2/1-2) under rehabilitation. Discharge planning was under progress.

社工紀錄/n病房訪視與病人妹妹會談：
1.病家已有找皇家、佳和、樂融等三間護理之家，預計今日下午會病房訪視與機構了解收費，因一般機構收置病人都是需要先收第一個月的費用及兩個月的訂金，這筆費用對病家確實是一大負擔，已請妹妹與機構先討論第一個月的收費費用，以方便本院、雙和社福中心與慈濟基金會評估機構安置補助。
2.目前雙和醫院尚在評估是否收病人住院做腦部治療，另病人妹妹仍想嘗試台北慈濟是否能收治病人做高壓氧治療，妹妹瞭解無法一直住院等待其他醫院收治評估，目前知道雙和醫院今日會來院評估，若可以收治會直接開住院通知單讓病人住院，預計下週一會知道結果，若下週一慈濟和雙和醫院都評估無法立即收治病人，妹妹了解就必須要做出院安置，會一併討論出院安置機構與出院安排。
3.因病家經濟狀況有限，一般安置機構要求的一個月月費及兩個月押金對病家確實是一大負擔，已請病家與機構討論第一個月的收費及免收押金，社工師也會協助病家與機構溝通，若目前有床的機構都不願意接受的話，會需要再找尋其他可能的機構，目前社工室與雙和社福中心社工師皆仍在積極找機構中。","2023-05-04

DIAGNOSIS: 社工評估：
1.經濟情況︰病人近兩年收入不穩定，醫療費用確實負擔困難。
2.照顧安排︰ 病人臥床需專人照顧，但病家唯一的照顧人力為病人母親，照顧能力有限。
3.家庭支持︰ 病人家人皆很關心病人，但經濟協助有限。
SUGGESTION: 社工計畫/建議：
1.已email病人妹妹申請本院補助應備之財稅及戶謄資料，請妹妹備齊來院評估經濟補助。
2.病人照顧安排：考量病人母親照顧能力有限，已向妹妹說明，若財稅資料來院評估符合本院補助對象，將補助病人住院期間夜班看護費用，減輕病人母親照顧負荷。
3.病人出院後照顧安排：病家有安置照顧意願，但病家目前無任何社會福利身分，出院安置費用對病家是一大負擔，與病人妹妹說明待病家財稅資料來院後進一步評估病家狀況是否符合社福身分申請標準，並將通報脆弱家庭請求新北市社會局協助。

Her menopause started at the age of 49. However, she had vaginal bleeding on 2022/1/30 and it lasted for 5 days. The amount of blood required 5 pads a day and the color was bright red. Lower abdominal pain a few days before the bleeding and during the bleeding was also noticed. The VAS score was 8 out of 10 and the patient woke up at night because of the pain. The pain was intermittent and lasted for 2-3 days on each episode. The patient denied urinary frequency, urinary retention, painful intercourses and dizziness.
   The patient went to Dr. 許博欽’s OPD on 2022/2/14 for the bleeding and a vaginal sonography was arranged. The sonography on 2022/2/22 showed endometrium thickening (8.6mm), EM flow(-), uterine myomas, two pelvic tumors, suspect pedunculated subserosal myomas, R/O right hydrosalpinx.

This 30-year-old, gravida-1-para-0 woman is pregnant for 27+6 weeks. She received regular prenatal examination at Dr. 戴's OPD. 

First trimester chromosome abnormalities screening revealed low risk for chromosome abnormalities. Amniocentesis was not performed. Level II sonography revealed MCDA twin. Her blood pressure remained in normal range during gestation. OGTT test showed positive for gestation diabetes, pending referral to nutritionist for recommendation. 

On arrival to our obstetric ward today, patient mentioned decreased fetal movement for a day, NST showed category I, FHB baseline 160bpm, with moderate variability, regular uterine contraction 1/3 min were noted. Due to regular uterine contraction despite treatment of Atannal and Anpo, she was admitted for tocolysis.

建議事項:
. I had explained the possible complications and the management of preterm birthto the mother
. Please keep tocolysis and monitor fetal heart beats as your expertise
. Please complete antenatal steroid course for fetal lung maturation
 Repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids should be considered in women who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days and whose prior course of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously. Rescue course corticosteroids could be provided as early as 7 days from the prior dose if indicated by the clinical scenario.
. Please call NI standby if the delivery is inevitable

Thank you for consultation!!

# One fetus has absent end-diastolic velocity (AEDV) in the umbilical artery.
# Uterine contractions continue, with ongoing tocolysis therapy.
# Patient remains hospitalized for close monitoring and management of preterm labor and fetal well-being.","This week, the patient, pregnant with MCDA twins at 27+6 weeks gestation, underwent tocolysis for regular uterine contractions. On 09/27 and 09/28, Rinderon was administered, followed by MgSO4 for neuroprotection on 09/28. By 09/29, abdominal tenderness had improved, and uterine contractions were managed with Tractocile. On 10/02, a dietitian was consulted for gestational diabetes management, and insulin therapy was initiated with Novorapid 3U TIDAC and Levemir 7U HS. On 10/03, the patient's knowledge about food and nutrition was assessed, and dietary education was provided. On 10/05, an ultrasound revealed twin A was appropriate for gestational age, while twin B was small for gestational age with abnormal Doppler findings, including REDV at the placental site. The patient's insulin dose was adjusted to Novorapid 4U TIDAC and Levemir 8U HS on 10/06. Throughout the week, the patient's vital signs remained stable, and fetal heart beats were monitored. A plan for potential cesarean section on 10/13 was discussed if REDV persists.",OBGY

  He had periumbilical blunting pain with VAS 5/10-9/10 and tea-colored urine since 2023/04/06. Also, he had vomitting once on 4/7, twice on 04/08 and once on 4/9 with brown content. He didn' have food intake since 4/9. He visited our ER on 4/6, while KUB showed no specific bowel gas. He then visited 陽明 ER again fro non-improved symptoms. Obstuctive jaundice and ascites were told, so the patient was transferred to our ER for further evaluation.

  At triage, his vital signs were stable with BT:36.6℃, PR:114/min, RR:18/min, BP: 94 / 61 mmHg and SpO2:96%. Blood test revealed elevated AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and lipase; direct type hyperbilirubinemia(3.16/4.65); normal PT. Chest, abdomen and pelvsi CT on 4/12 revealed: new infiltrative lesion in the pancreatic head and duodenum 2nd to 3rd portions, suspect metastasis; CBD stenosis and dilated gallbladder, CHD and intrahepatic bile ducts; mildly dilated main pancreatic duct with small amount of fluid around the pancreatic tail, suspect acute pancreatitis. Also, new lymphadenopathies in the paraaortic, hepatic hilum to gastrohepatic ligament was noted. Therefore, tumor-enlargment-related bile duct dilation and pancreatitis were suspected. 

  After admission, the patient reported diffuse abdominal pain without fever, diarrhea and vomitting. PE showed diffuse abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness. icteric sclera and yellowish skin was noted.

# Patient has brachial plexus compression and Horner syndrome due to the carcinoma.
# Acute pancreatitis is suspected to be related to tumor progression.
# Pleural effusion is suspected to be caused by tumor-related lymphatic obstruction.
# Patient has a history of A-com aneurysm, status post left frontotemporal craniotomy and rescue stent-assisted coiling.
# Type 2 diabetes mellitus is being managed with Repaglinide and Metformin.
# Hyperlipidemia is being treated with Pitavastatin calcium and Dipyridamole.
# Patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease, insomnia, and an enlarged prostate with relieved lower urinary tract symptoms.
# Left neck lymph node biopsy results showed PD-L1:85%, EGFR-, ALK-, RAS-, BRAFV600E-, with MET amplification and NF1 E1889.","This week, the patient experienced persistent abdominal pain and tea-colored urine, with a pain score of 8 on 04/13, which was managed with morphine and later fentanyl patch. On 04/13, a left thoracentesis was performed, revealing 330ml of bloody content, with lab data suggesting exudate and suspected tumor-related lymphatic obstruction. The patient's condition was further complicated by progressive jaundice due to biliary tract obstruction. A radiology consultation for PTCD was considered but deemed high-risk due to antiplatelet therapy and ascites, recommending instead to hold antiplatelet or consult GI for endoscopic management. By 04/14, the patient's abdominal pain was better controlled, with a pain score of 0. An assessment note on 04/14 suggested arranging abdomen echography, considering ERCP +/- ERBD, and correcting coagulopathy to keep the patient hemodynamically stable.",MED

After admission we keep inotrope support. CVVHDF was added for persisted latic acidosis. Antibioitcs was shifted to cefotaxime and metronidazole for suspect IAI. Compoent therpay was kept for tumor bleeding. NG diet was tried once but failed due to poor digetion suspect tumor compression. Thsu TPN was given. Family meeting was held and GI specilist was involved. Poor prognosis was informed and family favored immunotherpay if clinical feasible and decided no chest compression nor electrical cardioversion. CVVHDF was off on 9/28 after improvement of latic acidosis and shift to SLED since 9/29. Weaning parameter was test on 9/29 with poor muscle strength. Fluctuation of consciousness was noted on 9/30. No focal neurological sign noted. Fentanyl was off with partical improvement. Hepatic encephalopathy was favored. Extubation was thus hold. Family meeting was held on 10/1 and HCC treatment was inappropriated currently. The family consented to try weaning after informing risk of re-intubation.",,"MED: Informant:wife
Conscious change since 9/24 morning","MED: [Present illness]
This 71 y/o man denied underlying diseases. He was with totally independent ADL previously.

The patient noted poor appetite (50% of original amount), BW loss, and general malaise since 110/5. He noted bilateral leg edema since 110/8. About 1-2 weeks before admission, he felt much fatigue, with yellowish skin, nausea, tea color urine, and abdominal distention. He denied fever. On 110/9/20, he came to Dr. 楊志宏's OPD. Ascites, lower limbs edema, and palpable mass over the epigastric area were found. CXR showed multiple nodules, r/o metastases. Lab data revealed cholestatic hepatitis (T-BIL 4.61, D-BIL 2.17, AST 277, ALT 124, ALP 568, GGT 722) with Alpha-Fetoprotein > 80000. Abdominal tumor with lung metastases was impressed, and he was arranged with admission.

However, orthostatic hypotension was found on 9/24 morning. His wife found him drowsy. He was sent to our ER immediately. At triage, blood pressure was relatively low (92/59 mmHg). Lactic acidosis (pH 7.178, HCO3 13.8) was found with leukocytosis, elevated total bilirubin, and elevated creatinine level. Septic shock with AKI and shock liver were impressed. HCC related hyperbilirubinemia is also suspected. Due to dyspnea and conscious disturbance, the patient was intubated. Chest to abdominal CT showed huge HCC with bilateral lung metastases. Radiologist was consulted for TAE, but no active bleeding was found. The patient is admitted for further management.

This is a 71-year-old man had newly diagnosed HCC with tumor rupture.

After admission we keep inotrope support. CVVHDF was added for persisted latic acidosis. Antibioitcs was shifted to cefotaxime and metronidazole for suspect IAI. Compoent therpay was kept for tumor bleeding. NG diet was tried once but failed due to poor digetion suspect tumor compression. Thsu TPN was given. Family meeting was held and GI specilist was involved. Poor prognosis was informed and family favored immunotherpay if clinical feasible and decided no chest compression nor electrical cardioversion. CVVHDF was off on 9/28 after improvement of latic acidosis and shift to SLED since 9/29. Weaning parameter was test on 9/29 with poor muscle strength. Fluctuation of consciousness was noted on 9/30. No focal neurological sign noted. Fentanyl was off with partical improvement. Hepatic encephalopathy was favored. Extubation was thus hold. We would hold family meeting on 10/1 for further treatment discussion.","2021-09-30

She was admitted this time for C/S due to previous adenomyosis s/p LSC wedge resection history. The surgery went successfully on 2023/8/28 without postpartum events. However the duty was called on the same night due to decreased HR to 34 bpm. ECG showed frequent PVC in bigeminy pattern. Saturation was also decreased to 95% under ambient air. Nasal cannula 2L was given and the saturation improved to 98%. The patient had medical history of VPC and underwent ventricular radiofrequent ablation twice in 2022/6 and 2022/10. The latest 24hr EKG in 2021/3 showed frequent ventricular ectopies (31857 beats 32.8%) with 3 triplets 499 couplets 24697 beats in bigeminy and 1800 beats in trigeminy. The remaining were single PVCs. She denied chest pain chest tightness and palpitation. CV phone consult was made and survey was done according to their suggestion. Magnesium and Calcium supplement were added according to results of lab data (Ca:2.08mmol/L Mg:0.74mmol/L). Chest x ray revealed no specific findings. 24hr-EKG-monitor was given which showed multiple VPCs (30+/min). SpO2 was kept above 95% under ambient air with nasal cannula PRN use. CV suggested that we keep monitor on until discharge and arrange CV OPD follow-up afterwards. The patient asked for the possibility of removing ekg monitor since it influenced the quality of sleep on the next day but repeated 12-lead ecg at 15:00 on 8/30 showed prolonged QTc (451 ms) and after explaining the risk of VPC and torsades de pointes the patient agreed to continuing ecg monitor. Saturation would be monitored regularly. Under relatively stable condition she would be discharged tomorrow.,,"OBGY: Informant: patient and EMR
Pregnancy for 38+2 weeks, with previous adenomyosis s/p LSC wedge resection history","OBGY: 【Present illness】
This 44-year-old, gravida-2-para-0 woman is pregnant for 38+2 weeks. She received regular prenatal examination at Dr.康's OPD.

This pregnancy was conceived via in vitro fertilization. Preeclampsia screening test revealed low risk. NIPT revealed low risk for Down syndrome. Amniocentesis was not performed. SMA and fragile X genetic testing revealed normal results. Level II sonography did not show major anomaly of the fetus.

Reviewing her history, her first pregnancy was found to be blighted ovum in 2013. She also underwent laparoscopic wedge resection due to adenomyosis in 2019. Due to previous surgery history, she is admitted on 2023/8/27 for scheduled Cesarean section.

This 44-year-old gravida-2-para-0 woman is pregnant for 38+2 weeks. She was admitted this time for C/S due to previous adenomyosis s/p LSC wedge resection history. The surgery went successfully on 2023/8/28 without postpartum events. However the duty was called on the same night due to decreased HR to 34 bpm. ECG showed frequent PVC in bigeminy pattern. Saturation was also decreased to 95% under ambient air. Nasal cannula 2L was given and the saturation improved to 98%. The patient had medical history of VPC and underwent ventricular radiofrequent ablation twice in 2022/6 and 2022/10. The latest 24hr EKG in 2021/3 showed frequent ventricular ectopies (31857 beats 32.8%) with 3 triplets 499 couplets 24697 beats in bigeminy and 1800 beats in trigeminy. The remaining were single PVCs. She denied chest pain chest tightness and palpitation. CV phone consult was made and survey was done according to their suggestion. Magnesium and Calcium supplement were added according to results of lab data (Ca:2.08mmol/L Mg:0.74mmol/L). Chest x ray revealed no specific findings. 24hr-EKG-monitor was given which showed multiple VPCs (30+/min). SpO2 was kept above 95% under ambient air with nasal cannula PRN use. CV suggested that we keep monitor on until discharge and arrange CV OPD follow-up afterwards. The patient asked for the possibility of removing ekg monitor since it influenced the quality of sleep on the next day but repeated 12-lead ecg at 15:00 on 8/30 showed prolonged QTc (451 ms) and after explaining the risk of VPC and torsades de pointes the patient agreed to continuing ecg monitor. Saturation would be monitored regularly.","2023-08-31

Tracing back to his history, initial presentation of his neuroendocrine tumor was weight loss(10kg in 6 months), diarrhea, frequent flushing and cold sweating. In 慈濟 hospital, an endoscopic mucosal resection of gastric polyp on 2016/2/12 showed neuroendocrine tumor. He then visited NTUH for treatment. CT on 2016/3/8 showed TxN0M0, he received robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction on 2016/03/21. However, the flushing and sweating persisted. He received another abdominal CT on 2016/8/1 and showed a hypervascular 1.1cm S7 tumor with statinoary size compared with 2016/3/8. EUS on 2016/8/5 showed pancreatic tumors, neck, body and tail, suspected NETs. He starts octreotide treatemnt since 2016/8/2. Follow-up EUS on 2016/11/21 showed 3.9mm hypoechoic tumor at pancreatic tail, two hypoechoic tumors at pancreatic body, and one hypoechoic tumor at pancreatic neck. Alcohol injection was also performed. Due to persistent sysmtoms, he received second and third EUS guided ethanol injection on 2017/2/27 and 2017/05/10. CT-guided alcohol injection was performed on 2017/8/15. However, post ethanol injection related pancreatitis was noted, complicated with pancreatic pseudocyst and wall-off necrosis and recurrent infection. Pigtail drainage for pancreatic pseudocyst was done since 2018/05/08. However, incomplete drain function with recurrent infection were still noted. Thus, GS VS Yang was consulted for surgical treatment and Whipple surgery was suggested. The operation of Pancreaticoduodenectomy with Blumgart pancreaticojejunostomy (duct-to-mucosa) was performed on 2018/07/16.

During followup, a protruding mass over gastric suture site wa snoted. He underwent endoscopic biopsy on 2020/06/29 and showed anastomosis site chronic ulcer at posterior wall, suspect recurrence. Due to hypervascular hepatic lesions at S4a and S6, metastases could not be ruled out, he underwent CT guided RFA on 2020/07/03. Since then, he received regular upper endoscopy and colonoscopy every 6 months and under Octreotide every 4 weeks.

The patient suffered recurrent fever, chills, with RUQ pain and was hospitalized in 2021/09, (2022/01/11-01/20). Favored related to cholangitis, inflammation at pancreatojejunostomy anastomostic site and upper incisor gingival abscess. Bone scan (2022/01/04) showed no definite osteoblastic metastatic bone lesion.

The patient suffered fever up to 38.5 with chills one time. He aslo complained intermittent RUQ pain, with tenderness. The abdominal pain was localized to one point, no radiation or shifting. The pain increased when palpation, not related to food or posture. He also had left upper back pain, the pain increased when turning. Due to fever, lab and septic workup in 中山H showed leukocytosis and elevated CRP (4.9). He took acetaminophen regularly (Q6H) and was discharged. No antibiotics was given. Due to increasing right chest pain with left upper back pain, the patient came to NTUH ER for help.

On triage, he was afebrile, no nausea, vomiting. He had decreased appetite and 3kg weight loss in 3 months. He denied dysuria, diarrhea, constipation, headache, numbness, or chest tightness. Lab showed no leukocytosis. Abdominal echo showed 1.7 cm hyperechoic hepatic lesion, post-RFA effect, and no dilated intrahepatic ducts. 

After admission, we kept flumarin as empirical antibiotic therapy. However, intermittent abdominal pain extending to anterior chest was noticed. ECG and troponin T showed normal. NTG did not relieved his symptoms. Therefore, Thallium scan was arranged on 3/29 and showed to ischemia. His symptoms also improved after analgesic use. Due to relative stable condition of him, he was discharged on 3/31 with return visit scheduled.

In 2022/09, he had multiple bone pain over bilateral pubic, clavicle, forearm, tibial for 1 year. The symptom was symmetric and migratory. BW loss from 72 to 65kg were noted. Lab showed WBC 6.82k without significant abnormal differentiation, Ca 2.40, ALB 4.9, TP 7.2, CRE 1.1, LDH 165. He was admitted for PET scan on 2022/09/17.

On 2023/02/14, fever up to 39.2'C was noted. Chills, right upper abdominal pain, poor appetite and slightly dark-colored urine was reported as well. He denied yellowish of skin, chest tightness, chest pain, dizziness, change in bowel habit, decreased urination or dysuria. Due to the above symptoms, he visited 中山醫院 and blood culture revealed wild type E.coli. Curam and antipyretics were given and his fever subsided. However, chills and abdominal pain were still occassionally noted, so he visited Dr.胡婉妍's clinic at NTUCC. Urinalysis, urine and blood culture were obtained. Admission was suggested and he was thus admitted to our ward on 2023/02/17. Upon admission, he denied fever or chills. Physical examination revealed mild RUQ tenderness, while knocking pain was not noted. Lab tests were done and empirical antibiotics was prescribed.

Vaginal spotting noted after menstruation since 2021/03","OBGY: 【Present Illness】 
   This is a 50-year-old female, P1(C/Sx1), without previous systemic disease.
   Vaginal spotting after menstruation has been noted since 2021/03. The patient denied bloody stool nor hematuria, small stream, incomplete emptying, nor tenesmus, difficult defecation, nor anemia associated dyspnea, dizziness, palpitation, nor general malaise, body weight loss, nor anorexia. Urinary frequency was also complained.
   The patient visited 汐止國泰hospital. Sonogram showed EM 18 mm. Pap smear showed ASCUS. Cervical biopsy was done and showed SCC. Lab data showed CEA: 1.88 ng/ml, CA125 20.2 U/ml, CA19-9 9.4 U/ml, SCC: 0.8 ng/ml. The patient then came to our clinic for further evaluation. PV showed one 2 cm tumor over anterior lip with easily touching bleeding, bilateral free adnexa. Cervical SCC stage Ib1 at least was impressed. 
   This time, due to cervical cancer, she was admitted for MRI survey first and then RAH, BSO and BPLND on 05/11.

After admission IV perdipine was given for strick BP goal less then 160 mmHg. Follow-up NCCT on 3/17 showed stationary left thalamic hematoma with IVH. Anti-hypertensive agents was switchted to oral form and perdipine pump was off on 3/17. Besides CXR upon admission showed cardiomegaly with suspected bilateral pleural effusion. I/O was kept balance. For his neurological condition he was still drowsy but arousable but GCS was E3M6V5. NE showed transcortical motor aphasia right hemiparesis right hypoesthesia and inconsistent right hemineglect. 

On 3/18 night fever up to 38.6'C was noted. No obvious sysmtpoms noted including productive cough or dysuria. Fever work-up was done on 3/19. Lab data showed mild leukocytosis (6.43 -> 8.67) elevated CRP levels (0.47 -> 3.95). Urine analysis was clear. CXR showed still opacities in LLL. Empirical Unasyn for suspected pneumonia. Under the stable neurological status he was transferred to the ordinary ward on 3/19.

VS Note/n71M underlying HTN CKD was admitted for Lt thalamus ICH with IVH on 3/16.

Pneumonia with spiking fever was noted after stroke with prorgession. 

Unasyn was shifted to Tazocin on 3/20 then his fever curve improved gradually with less sputum.

3/22 WBC 6850 seg 72.7% CRP 23.11

BUN 27.7 Cre 2.2 (increasing) due to infection or dehydration?

Neurologically he can mildly move left upper limb and mildly extent left lower limb with paraphasia and mild dysarthria. 

He denied any choking event. The fever has good response to Tazocin so bacterial infection is most likely.

P:
1. F/U CXR every 2-3 days. Keep Tazocin because symptoms and most infection profile improved (CRP reactivity may be delayed).
2. F/U infection profile BUN cre Na k tomorrow.
3. I/O goal +150~+250 ml/8h and with PRN N/S infusion if I/O is inadequate
4. Keep on rehab

so he DID NOT take salt completely.

Plan
- Keep current abx
- Consider education for intake
 > 亞培etc for supplement
 > Salt supplement

VS's comment:
1. Work up for hyponatremia according to flow chart (SIADH? poor intake? adrenal? thyroid? etc.)
2. Add butin 1# BID for suspect superimposed central fever (due to IVH)
3. Sputum impaction may also induce fever may also add Atrovent IH due to his underlying COPD/asthma 
4. Arrange KUB for poor appetite and check other etiologies of poor intake (swallowing problem? low mood? gastric problem?decreased activity? diet problem?)
5. For inadequate I/O the goal is +500~+750ml/day so N/S order can be adjusted to N/S 250 ml if I/O =150ml/8h.

VS'S comment:
The consciousness disturbance in this patient is mainly related to the damage of intralaminar and reticular nucleus. 
The impaired appetetite is probably related to hypothalamus involvement by the perifocal edema.

Rectal melanoma with right side inguinal and pelvic side wall lymphoadenopathies, status post trans-anal resection(2022/09/07), status post Nivolumab(III, C1D1=2022/11/06, C3D1=2022/12/12), disease progression with enlarged pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy and suspicious new liver metastasis, status post Avastin + Nivolumab (I, C1D1=2023/01/05), status post clinical trial of NGM707(II, C1D1=2023/02/09-C2D1=2023/3/3), disease progression at right inguinal LAP and left pelvic LAP, resume Avastin + Nivolumab (II-VII, C2D0=2023/3/18, C7D0=2023/08/07), disease progression with enlarged tumor, pelvic and inguinal lymphadenopathy, status post Ipilimumab(I, C1D1=2023/07/03)
2. Diabetes mellitus, newly diagnosed in 2022/07, HbA1c 8.9% on 2023/06/21

 The patient was ADL/iADL independent and incidentally found a rectal mass in 2022. She went to 萬芳Hospital for help and colonoscope on 2022/08/08 reported a 2cm hard and dark polypoid tumor, suspected to be anal cancer or melanoma. Surgical excision was performed on 2022/09/07 and pathology revealed an anal melanoma. PET on 2022/09/13 reported (1) residual malignancy of anus or physiological glucose metabolism.(2) Multiple lymph node metastasis in pelvic sidewalls, right inguinal region, and possible early metastasis in a right peri-rectal node.

 She went to NTUH surgeon Dr.周's OPD for second opinion and was referred to CRS Dr. Lin and oncologist Dr. Huang's OPD. The LAP was too extensive to dissect completely. Thus, systemic therapy was considered first. Nivolumab was administered on 2022/11/06(C1D1), 11/28(C2D1) and 12/12(C3D1). However, the inguinal lymphadenopathies were reported to have increased in size and number, being 3 2cm-in-size nodes. Colonoscope was performed on 2022/12/30, showing a rectal lesion at cecum and proximal colon, suspect residual tumor or rectal varices. Biopsy was not done due to vascular lesion can not be ruled out.

 Bilateral gluteal pain was noted when sitting. Lab data showed leukocytosis and increased platelet. For suspected progressive disease, computed tomography was performed on 2023/01/02. The report revealed (1)Suspect a liver metastasis in S2 1.0cm; (2)Lymphadenopathies in the right inguinal region and bilateral iliac regions, more and larger than in CT (in PET/CT) on 2022/9/12; (3)Fat-stranding at the left perirectal fat, suspect infection/inflammation, new. Under the progression disease, anti-cancer treatment was shifted to Avastin+Nivolumab on 2023/01/05=C1D0. 

 CT-guided right inguinal lymph node biopsy was done on 01/04 and pathology report revealed melanoma, metastatic. BRAF gene mutation analysis showed mutation not detected. The patient agreed to enrolled clinical trial and trial screening CT scan was done on 01/27 which showed decreased size of liver metastatic tumors and pelvic and left inguinal LAP after last cycle of avastin and nivolumab. Clinical trial was however initiated. She received clinical trial of NGM707 study on 2023/02/09(C1D1) and 03/03(C2D1). She reported general muscle aches. The followed up CT on 2023/3/16 revealed disease progression at right inguinal LAP and left pelvic LAP. Thus, NGM707 trial was discontinued. EOT on 2023/03/17. After discussion, avastin + nivolumab was resumed. She received Avastin+Nivolumab on 2023/3/18 (C1D0), 05/22 (C5D0). 

 However, follow up CT on 2023/06/19 showed progressive disease with larger rectal melanoma and larger lymphadenopathies in the right inguinal region, bilateral pelvis, perirectal region. She also complained of right pelvic soreness. Ipilimumab infusion was started on 07/03. The patient stated generalized itchiness without skin rash, suspected side effect of Ipilimumab. Allegra and depoxin was given for symptom control. Under relative stable condition, the patient was discharged on 2023/07/18 with OPD follow up. For disease progression(right pelvic pain), she was admitted for self-paid Nivolumab+Avastin treatment C7. 

 Due to intolerable painful sensation while voiding, dysuria and constipation in recent days, the patient visited NTUH ER on 2023/08/24. The urine analysis showed mild pyuria and urine culture reported no aerobic pathogen. The urinary tract infection could be ruled out. Upon admission this time, elevated liver enzymes and ALP are noted and progressive cancer status is highly suspected. This time, she is admitted to oncology ward for further evaluation of cancer status and treatment.

He was referred to NTUH and colonoscopy on 2020/09/22 showed two colon polyps, 0.5cm and 0.3cm respectively, status post polypectomy. External hemorrhoids were also noted. Pathology report later revealed tubulous adenoma. He was followed up at NTUH OPD. However, MRI on 12/12 showed a 4.6cm cystic lesion in right retroperitoneum near A-colon, r/o old hematoma. He visited Dr.林本仁's OPD for second opinion, and operation was suggested. He denied abdominal pain, tenderness, bloating, bloody stool or any other discomfort.

This time, due to abdominal mass of unknown nature, he was admitted for laparoscopic excision.

Severeal syncope episodes after defecation or urination was noted which resolved in seconds. No significant abnormal in brain CT and lab data thus vasovagal syncope was suspected. After resting and patient education no syncope episode noted since 9/7.","ENT: Informant:patient

He was regular follow-up at our OPD due to sinonasal carcinoma. Loss of consciousness and fell down at bathroom was noted on 8/20, and he was then brought to ER. According to his family's statement, dysarthria was noted for one months and unsteady gait with deviatetion to left side was noted after fall down episode. Brain CT showed Increased soft tissue swelling at bilateral tonsil and retropharyngeal space, more on the right side. New cortical disruption of right occipital condyle, suspect local recurrence. Brain MRI showed Increased soft tissue at bilateral tonsil and retropharyngeal space, more on the right side, with local invasion to right occipital condyle, intracranial extension on the right side, and encasement of right ICA, suspect local recurrence. Under relative stable condition, he was discharged from ER on 2023/07/22.He came back to ENT OPD on 8/24. Nasopharyngoscope was done, necrotic tissue at left NP with crusting was revealed and biopsy was done. Further evaluation and management was arranged.
Under the impression of Sinonasal carcinoma with local recurrence and intracranial extension, he was admitted for further evalaution and management.

2023/08/24 CT: 
Postoperative and post-irradiation change. Advanced recurrent tumor with intracranial involvement and bilateral ICA encasement focal abnormal dilation or outpouching at right distal cervical ICA. No cervical lymphadenopathy.

2023/08/27 CT: 
1. a pseudo-aneurysm formation at right distal cervical ICA. 
2. necrotic tissue at central skull base region with bilateral ICA encasement.

2023/08/27 Perfusion CT: 
1. s/p right ICA embolization with mild prolong MTT at right MCA and PCA territories.
2. necrotic tissue at central skull base region with bilateral ICA encasement. 

2023/09/04 PET:
1. Metabolic regression change at left nasal cavity and left left cervical space.
2. New FDG-avid lesions at nasopharynx either due to infection/inflammation or malignancy suggest clinical correlation.

--------------------------------------
2023/09/20 follow up: 
His surgery wound recovered with decreased pus discharges now. 
His fever subsided but the CRP was still elevated after a treatment course of ceftriaxone and then unasyn. 
For the anaerobic Granulicatella adiacens fluoroquinolone seemed more effective from literature review. 

# Recommendations: 
1. We recommend changing antibiotics to Levofloxacin for his anaerobic wound infection. 
2. If his condition is not improving please consider repeat cultures and consider IVF antibiotics.

  He had been disease free until Jan-2022, when abdominal pain with fever and chills were noted. He visited TMUH and Mirizzi syndrome was diagnosed. He received cholecystectomy and his symptoms did not recur until Jan-2023 when abdominal pain, fever, and septic shock developed. Fever relieved after antibiotics but no obvious focus was discovered. However, occasional fever could be noted since and in early March-2023, he visited TMUH for another episode of fever. This time, comprehensive imaging survey including CT and MRI was done and hilar stricture was seen. PTCD was performed and his symptoms improved. Consequent bridging to retrograde stenting failed multiple times. Operation was suggested, but was denied by the patient. Therefore, he was referred to Dr. Kuo for stenting via PTC.

On April 25, 2023, the patient underwent PTA, but stenting failed due to complete occlusion and failed identification of the common bile duct. On April 28, he underwent Spyglass cholangiography and stenting via PTCD for selective cannulation, and endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) was successfully performed. Abdominal ultrasound on May 1, 2023, showed the ERBD stent in situ and a cutaneo-biliary fistulous tract. The patient was discharged in stable condition on May 2, 2023.

On May 17, 2023, the patient's total and direct bilirubin levels were 0.73 and 0.14 mg/dL, respectively, and his GGT was 210 U/L. He was not experiencing abdominal pain or fever. However, on May 24, 2023, he began to experience intermittent low-grade fever with chills, which subsided after receiving oral antibiotic treatment. He denied any pain, upper respiratory symptoms, urinary tract symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms. On May 31, 2023, CT scan revealed double pigtail external migration, and his GGT was elevated to 1128 U/L. His total and direct bilirubin levels were 0.79 and 0.19 mg/dL, respectively. ERBD revision was attempted on June 26, 2023, but failed. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) with Gadelius IT stent 7Fr 14cm was then performed.

The patient remained uneventful until August 30, 2023, when he presented to Dr. Kuo's clinic with a chief complaint of fever with chills for 4 days. He denied any other symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or dysuria. Blood tests showed mild elevation of total bilirubin (1.88 mg/dL). Hepaticogastrostomy stent dysfunction with acute cholangitis was suspected, and oral cefixime was prescribed. Computed tomography was done and showed Intrahepatic duct (IHD) dilatation with hepaticogastrostomy stent dysfunction. Abdominal ultrasound showed IHD dilatation at the B3 and right posterior branches. He was then admitted to the ward and HGS stent revision was done.

He was smooth during the outpatient clinic follow-up. He is now admitted for Spyglass (free) via HGS route to assist selective cannulation to left IHD.

   This 46-year-old, gravida-6-para-2-spontaneous abortion-3 woman is pregnant for 38+4 weeks, with underlying diseases of:
1. Antiophospholipid syndrome, under aspirin, plaquenil, predonin 

   She received regular prenatal examination at LMD, and was referred to Dr.林明緯's OPD after gestational week 20. Preeclampsia screening test revealed moderate risk and low dose Aspirin was taken from GA 12 to 37. First NIPT revealed low risk for Down syndrome. aCGH was performed and showed normal 46, XX. Level II sonography on 2022/03/25 showed aortic stenosis (aortic valve 1.77cm, SD=-4.42) with mild hypoplastic left ventricle. TR(+). Sonography examination at our clinic revealed singleton with fetal coarctation of aorta on 2022/06/29.

   Reviewing her history, her second pregnancy was complicated with fetal malpresentation , and Cesarean section delivery was performed. Due to previous Cesarean section, she is admitted on 2022/07/25 for scheduled Cesarean section.

2. Diabetes mellitus for years
3. Hypertension for years
4. Hyperlipidemia for years
5. Nasopharyngeal cancer since 1995, s/p radiotherapy, complicated with right auditory loss and right salivary gland impaired

The patient was last seen normal at 2023/10/27. On 10/29, he found himself dysarthria and dysphagia. On 10/30, he felt clumsy over his right hand when he was working. He had slurred speech, same as baseline according to his son. He was then brought to our ED at 2023/10/31 3:22PM.

At triage, vital signs showed Vital signs: blood pressure 184/113mmHg, pulse rate 83/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37.2℃, SPO2 99％. His NIHSS was 5 (000 001 0001 20010) at ER. Mild muscle power defecit was noticed over RUL: proximal 4+ distal 4+ and RLL: proximal 4+ distal 5. Finger-nose-finger test showed mild right hand dysmetria and Heel-knee-shin test showed RLL: proximal 4+ distal 5. 

Non-contrast CT on 2023/10/31 showed: 1) No intracranial hemorrhage, 2)Ill-defined hypodensities of periventricular white matter, 3)Atherosclerosis of intracranial arteries. TCD study on 11/1 showed reduced flow velocity in the left ACA. Doppler carotid sonography on 11/01 showed 1)Mild to moderate atherosclerosis in bilateral CCAs, carotid bulbs, and ICAs without significant hemodynamic changes, 2)>50%stenosis at bilateral ECAs. MRI showed 1)Ill-defined diffusion restriction and mild high signal intensity on T2/FLAIR at left paramedian pons, compatible with recent infarction, 2)Old insult at right medulla, 3)Multiple bilateral nonspecific hyperintensities over cerebral white matter on FLAIR, 4)Multiple microbleeds at bilateral temporal lobe and pons. Under the impression of acute ischemic stroke over left paramedian pons, the patient was admitted for further treatment.

This is a 64-year-old female with history of:

1. Hepatic tumor of inderterminate nature, suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
2. Chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1a, status post glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB), relapse
3. Essential hypertension (HTN)

The patient failed to 8-week Maviret therapy two years ago at 聯新 hospital, and she was referred to the gastroenterology department of NTUH on 2020/09/21 for further investigation. The lab test showed hepatitis C infection(HCV viral load:3790000(IU/mL), genotype 1a), and she started to wait for new reimbursed DAA agent. Since then, she admitted to gastroenterology department of NTUH two times on 2021/01/25 and 2021/04/12 for follow-up and new reimbursed DAA agent.
This time, due to fatigue and poor appetite since this September, she was referred to gastroenterology department of 聯新 hospital from her regular OPD for following up her hypertension every month. According to the CT images and elevated AFP, 5 HCCs around 1 cm was suspected by gastroenterology department of 聯新 hospital. Due to the suspected HCCs, she was referred to Dr劉俊人 OPD and was admitted to our ward for further evaluation.

Inquiry: Would MRI w/ Primovist be suggested for further work-up? 

We are consulted for second opinion of CT imaging which is done on 2022/9/20. 
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without/with contrast enhancement shows: 
> Fibrotic change of the bilateral lower lungs. 
> Uneven hepatic surface coarse hepatic architecture; liver cirrhosis is considered. Splenomegaly. 
> Several small(= 1cm) nodules at right hepatic lobe showing faint arterial enhancement and wash-out in PV/delayed phase compatible with HCCs. A 1.8cm hyperenhancing nodule at S6/7 of the liver showing faint hypodensity in delayed phase with indeterminate feature. Several hypodense nodules at both lobes of the liver showing no obvious enhancement dysplastic nodules are considered.
> A 1.0cm hepatic cyst at S8. 
> Atrophy of the right kidney with a renal stone and cyst. 
> No definite focal lesions in the gallbladder pancreas bilateral adrenals and left kidney.
> Unremarkable stomach and intestinal loops. No wall thickening of the colon.
> Atherosclerotic change with calcified plaque at the aortic wall and bifurcation. Patent portal vein and IVC.
> No definite lesions at the urinary bladder uterus and bilateral adnexae. 
> No definite abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy. 
> No ascites. 
> Wedge-shaped deformity of T11 suspected compression fracture. Mild degenerative changes of the spine with marginal spur formation.

 According to the patient, he had initial chest pain with dyspnea since 2012. He recieved CAG on 2012/08/31 which showed CAD, 3VD (LM: patent, LAD: proximal 90%, D1 90% stenosis (bifurcation 1-1-1 lesion), LCX: proximal 80% stenosis, distal irregularity, RCA: proximal, mid, distal 50% stenosis, PDA multiple lesions up to 70% stenosis). Then one DES to middle LAD and two BMS to middle LCx with PCI to RCA was performed. After discharged, he has been regularly followed at Cardiologist of this hospital and self-reported adherence is good.
 Since three months prior to this admission, he noticed frequent exertional dyspnea, especially after climbing 2 flight of stairs, hiking or climbing mountain. The duration was around 1~2 minutes and could be relieved by taking a deep breath and resting. He denied any aggravating factors, chest tightness, chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea. Echocardiogram on 2020/10/07 showed EF(sp4-el): 50.8 %, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly reduced LV systolic function, mild basal inferior hypokinesis, mild MR, AR and trace TR. Thallium-201 scan (Dipyridamole & Resting) on 2020/10/19 showed mild to moderate reversible perfusion defects at apex, mid to basal septum, and mid inferior wall. Therefore, he underwent Cardiac catheterization on 2020/11/05 showed CAD, 3VD (LM: patent, LAD: proximal ISR 80 %, LCX: no ISR,RCA: distal stenosis 95 %, distal -PLA stenosis 99%, proximal stenosis 80 %). Then PCI with BMS implantation to LAD (Medtronic INTEGRITY2.5*18mm) and proximal RCA-PLA (BOSTON stent REBEL 2.5 *32 mm and 2.75*24 mm) to was performed smoothly. 
 However, follow-up Thallium-201 scan on 2021/11/25 showed (1) severely reduced flow reserve with stress-induced ischemia at septum, apical to mid anterior, mid anterolateral, and inferior walls (SD%=31%), (2) transmural scar at apex and subendocardial scar at apical septum, mid anteroseptum, apical anterior, and apical to mid inferior walls (SR%=16%), (3) dilated LV with moderately reduced LV systolic function and stress-induced LV dysfunction. Chest tightness was noted 2-3 weeks before this admission. He complained of orthopnea and paraxysmal noctural dyspnea. He could relieve his symptoms by standing up and resting. Bilateral lower legs pitting edema and weight gain for 3kg(57->60kg) were also noted. Besides, he also had dry cough and decreased appetite to about 3/4 of his baseline. Under the impression of coronary artery disease, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization.

[Indication for admission]
嚴重精神病症狀，需急性治療者。
因精神症狀嚴重影響家庭，而必須住院治療者。","PSYC: [Present Illness] 
The patient is a 57-year-old patient with no known underlying systemic diseases. He was tam and introverted in nature. He was graduated from 淡江大學會計系 and had worked as 好樂迪稽查主管 for years and as 稽查主管 at ATT 4 fun later. The patient had been unemployed in the past 3 years and he had been taking care of his mother who passed away in 2023/08. He and his wife divorced and the patient had been living with his 2 daughters and 1 son. He drank alcohol very occasionally and denied illicit drug use. There was no known psychiatric family history.

According to past medical records (information from ex-wife), he had an episode of elevated mood and hypertalkativeness in his 30s, which was self-limited. He maintained fair function and stable mood until age 48, when another manic episode developed. He was presented with an elevated, expansive and irritable mood. Hypertalkativeness (本來是很木訥的人，一天回家說不到三句話，忽然開始變得多話), decreased need for sleep, grandiosity (覺得自己可以接副總的工作，沒有當副總是因為他自己不願意去), buying sprees (買了超多饅頭回家，過年時訂購了半個客廳的年菜，買了一堆巧克力要送給小朋友，過年買了一大堆金紙) and persecutory delusion (覺得其他主管同事要害自己，太太說他壓力太大不要太辛苦，就說是太太要害他) were noted. Bipolar I disorder, manic episode was diagnosed at Dr. 陳宜明's clinic, but he had poor drug compliance. He also had conflicts frequently with other colleagues and customers. He was admitted to our psychiatric ward for the first time during 2014/02-03, and was discharged with quetiapine 800 mg/day, valproic acid 1500 mg/day, and haloperidol 2.5 mg/day. After discharge, he had been followed-up at Dr. 陳宜明's clinic, with medication later simplified to valproic acid 1250 mg/day and soon lost follow-up. The patient had a third manic episode at age 54 (2020/04/28-05/27), and was again admitted to the psychiatric ward at NTUH. His mainline medication had been adjusted to quetiapine 700 mg/day, trifluoperazine 20 mg/day and valproic acid 1250 mg/day. However, as a pattern, he soon lost follow-up. There was no previous depressive symptoms noted. 

According to the patient’s daughter, the patient had been generally stationary after discharge. Although not returning to work, he helped take care of his mother. However, the patient’s mother had been progressively ill since mid 2022, and the patient had been in much stress (開始會傳很多媽媽的照片影片給家人、帶媽媽看很多不必要的診；但兒女尚未覺得情緒上有明顯變化). In 2023/04, after the patient’s mother was hospitalized, he had been gradually presented with elevated and irritable mood (突然很亢奮笑著講很多話、也很容易感到煩躁), flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep (照顧祖母睡眠作息混亂, 到2023/08甚至好幾天都沒睡), and hypertalkativeness. He had increased dispute with the medical staff, and later developed persecutory delusion and delusion of being monitored (覺得醫生是故意害死媽媽、也要對自己不利；覺得病友家屬是便衣警察，戴著airpod是在竊聽；覺得自己手機持續被監控，要把line刪掉、手機關機). Hallucinatory behavior of self-talking was observed by his family and there was suspected auditory hallucination. The patient’s mother passed away in 2023/08, and he had been reporting suicidal ideation for the first time ever (第一次說自己要自殺、要去死). After the 告別式 on 2023/09/12, the patient had changed his house’s lock and left home. His family couldn’t find him and they decided to report to the police. He was reported to be seen in 高雄枋寮 on 2023/09/24, but later went to 台東太麻里. The family was contacted on 2023/09/28 due to the bizarre behavior of the patient (在鄰里遊蕩，會對路人咆哮). They went to 台東 and upon their encounter with the patient, the patient tried to attack them and the passerby with his umbrella. He was sent to the ED at 台東 where tranquilizer was given, and the family asked for transferring to the emergency department of this hospital on 9/29. 
 Upon visiting, elevated CK=1234, leukocytopenia, neutrocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia were noted, while there was no prominent ecchymosis or evidence for bleeding tendency. QTc prolong=475 was noted on EKG. Elated mood, irritaility, distractability, grandiosity, and hypertalkativeness were noted during the stay in the emergency department. Rivotril (0.5) 0.5# Q12H, seroquel (200) 1# HS, depakine (500 ) 1# HS were prescribed. After hematologist was consulted and workup for leukocytopenia/thrombocytopenia was done, and after adequate hydration for rhabdomyolysis, the patient was admitted for further management and followup.

He was born to a G2P2 mother, in GA 40+0 weeks, via vaginal delivery without perinatal insults. He had proper home care, received vaccination as scheduled, and had achieved normal growth and developmental milestones. 

This time, he had progressive productive cough and rhinorrhea with transparent clearage for two days (since 3/23 night), followed by increased work of breathing and wheezing for one day since 3/24 morning. During this period, he had fair activity, appetite and urine output. There was no fever, no nausea, no vomiting, no abdominal pain, no diarrhea, no dysuria, no skin rash, no red eyes. Due to progressive cough and dyspnea, he was brought to our OPD for help. At OPD, wheezing was noted.

Exacerbated auditory hallucination with thoughts insertion for four months

[Indication for admission]
嚴重精神病症狀，需急性治療者。
精神病理複雜，需住院觀察，以建立診斷與治療計畫者。","PSYC: [Present Illness] 
  The 26-year-old male was introvert and easy-going in nature. He had a history of childhood developmental delay (walked when he was aged 18 months and spoke first words when he was aged 3) and relative poor academic performance (後段班，小學曾上資源班) during his school life. His performance was relatively fair at literature, history and geography but poor at mathematics. His motor development seemed to be normalized during childhood. Due to the developemental retardation, he was regularly followed at neurologist's outpatient clinic at CGMH and he was ever diagnosed as having autism spectrum disorder. 
  His first psychiatric symptoms presented when he was in the third grade at 士林高商. He reported that he had auditory and visual hallucination which manifestated as a man spoke to him in second person ""共濟會是信撒旦教的"" and seeing the face of ""毛澤東"" and ""馬克思"". At that time, he had no delusions or disorganized behavior. He did not seek medical help but the symptoms resolved spontaneously while he attirbuted the relief of symptoms to ""練法輪功"". The symptoms was in full remission until he was a senior student at college (德明科大大四). The auditory hallucination emerged again and the content was shifted to as ""你要去信邪教"" while the visual hallucination also recurred and was the same image as in before (""毛澤東"" and ""馬克思""). He still denied any delusional thoughts during the period. However, he began to ask his family frequently if the thoughts would be inserted to his mind ""這不是我想的吧?"". He denied depressed mood, flight of idea, decreased sleep requirement or compulsive behavior.
  He began to be anxious when facing these hallucination and started to receive aripriprazole treatment from CGMH with dose titration. However, no full remission was noted. He then visited several medical services as his symptoms could not be totally subsided and his mother was worried about the adverse effects from medication. He was ever visited at Taipei City Psychiatric Center (TCPC) where he received Solian 50-200 mg/d but his complaince was not fair. In 2021/10, he was brought by his mother to a 自然療法 clinic at Tainan where memantine and paliperidone was prescribed. Neverthless, he had significant exacerbation of hallucination, agitation and general discomforts after then. 
  He was then admitted to the psychiatric ward at TSGH from 2021/12/02 to 12/11. Olanzapine was given and slowly titrated up to 10 mg/d and he was then discharged after auditory hallucination resolved significantly. At psychiatric outpatient follow-up, olanzapine was further titrated up to 15 mg. His symptoms showed regression initially but recurrence was still inevitable. Besides, adverse effects from medication such as akathisia, shaking and slowness of gait then emerged. He then came to the psychiatric outpatient clinic at NTUH for second opinion. Olanzapine was slowly tapered down to 5 mg/d while clozapine tirated up to 150 mg/d. He still experienced frequent auditory hallucination with anxiety while adverse effects from clozapine, such as increased salivation, constipation and akathisia were still prominent. After discussing with the patient and his family, the patient was admitted this time for electroconsulsive therapy with impression of refractory schizophrenia.

After admission olanzapine 5 mg/day was discontinued and we up-titrated clozapine to 175 mg/day (not further up-titrated due to significant sedative effect and sialorrhea). ECT was performed with total duration of 315s with partial response and no significant cognitive impairment. There was still residual psychotic symptoms mainly presented with auditory hallucination and thought insertion of religious content thus haloperidol was added. Nevertheless due to limited effect of haloperidol 7.5 mg/day and the concern of EPS it was titrated to aripiprazole.

The patient was in his health status until 2020/05. He then suffered from intermittent tarry stool for about 2 months. In 2020/6, one episode of syncope happened after the patient was standing for some while. The patient was sent to 雙和H, where EGD on 2020/6/22 showed (1)gastric diffuse ulcerative mass, LC side of angularis to cardia area, with biopsy pathology report of adenocarcinoma (2)one Forrest IIb ulcer, antrum, 1cm. CT scan showed gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis, without obvious signs of liver metastasis or peritoneal seeding. Weight loss of 10 kg(86->74kg) was noted in one year. Total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y bypass and segmental lateral lobe of liver resection was done on 2020/07/13. Gastric cancer, scirrhous, adenocarcinoma, diffuse type, grade 3, pT4bN3aM1, with margin positive and peritoneal seedings was diagnosed. The patient was then referred to Oncology OPD for further chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy with Oxaliplatin and Xeloda for palliative treatment was innitiated on 2020/08/17 as C1D1. The patient had grade 1 neutropenia under this regimen. Neuropathy with numbmess was also complained. Abdominal CT on 2021/02/24 showed stable peritoneal metastases. Due to neuropathy, Oxaliplatin was hold. Xeloda was keeping for disease control.

However, EGD on 2022/2/10 showed recurrence at esophageal anastomosis site. (biopsy proven) Abdominal CT on 2022/10/13 showed local recurrent tumor at the anastomotic site. Under the impression of progressive disease, Oxaliplatin was added back on 2022/11/07. The recent CT on 2023/02/10 showed local recurrent tumor at the esophageal anastomotic site, generally stable in size, with dilated upstream esophagus, and Tiny nodules and irregular GGOs at the RLL, infection/inflammatory process is considered first.

The patient complained of dysphagia with epigastric discomfort after meals in this three months, which may be induced by the recurrent tumor at EGJ. Poor appetite with progressive body weight loss was noticed, with 10 kilograms loss in this two months. Bfluid was prescribed at OPD, but no obvious body weight gain was noticed. Therefore, TPN was indicated. Due to the above reasons, the patient was admitted to our ward for TPN training.

Hypotension/nI was informed of hypotension at 16:35. Upon visiting the patient no evident symptoms were noted. The patient had no dyspnea no chest tightness no sign of decompensated heart failure no fever and no tachycardia. No other symptoms were noted. I encouraged the patient to keep current fluid intake as well as food intake. Cardiovascular drugs such as beta blocker spironolactone and diovan could be put to hold during hypotension. We will continue to monitor her condition .

[訪視摘要] 會談對象：病人、女兒、二兒子
  今日訪視，病人臥床平躺，案子女陪伴在側。關心不適症狀，病人與案子表示睡前使用止痛藥(Ultraphen)後，除了腹部、腰部疼痛改善，夜間喘的情況也改善了；因此醫師預計將短效的藥物改成長效的藥物使用，希望白天的喘也能有所改善。案子表示尾底骨壓瘡傷口有一層反黑的死皮、皮膚會癢，詢問是否是惡化的跡象。予使用NS清潔後，表層死皮脫落，皮膚呈粉紅色，說明傷口癒合中，教導皮膚護理方法，建議持續翻身。
  案女表示許多照顧方法我們都不懂，很擔心返家很快又回到醫院，因此仍希望能先轉到緩和病房照顧，並已出院銜接安寧居家為目標。肯定案子女照顧之用心，說明安寧病房照顧，協助候床。

[後續照護計畫]
- 請持續協助病人舒適照顧，追蹤家屬照顧技能(會陰清潔、尾底骨壓瘡)
- 協助登記候床(1-> 2人)
- 持續關心病人及家人疾病調適情形，予情緒支持

For her baseline, the patient was ADL/iADL total independent. And lives with her boyfriend in 台中. She was hospitalized between 2022/08/17-202/08/27 at the Taichung branch of Tzu-Chi hospital(台中慈濟) for left flank pain and UTI and left pelvic hematoma were diagnosed. However, sudden onset of abdominal pain the urgent CT revealed suspected a bleeder in the left iliopsoas muscle status post TAE on 2022/08/24. ICU admitted at the time (2022/08/24-2022/08/26). Moreover, fever developed on 8/27, and Hb dropped to 4.3. A repeated CT scan showed no active bleeder. No hematemesis, tarry, or bloody stool passage during hospitalization. But persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia were noted. She was referred to CMUH(中國附醫) for further management on 2022/08/27.

During 2022/08/27-09/02 hospitalized at 中國附醫, Thrombocytopenia resolved later. PT, aPTT, von Willebrand profile, and factor II/VII/IX/X/XI were within normal limits. Followed CT scan on 2022/08/31 showed progressive hematoma. Factor XIII deficiency was considered. Also, a bone marrow biopsy was performed and awaiting formal results. Besides, she presented with sometimes incoherent speech. MRI of the brain was done and is pending a report. Due to hematoma and coagulopathy, she was referred to our NTUH ED for a workup on 2022/09/02.

Upon arrival at ED, she was awake with E: 4, V: 5, M: 6 Vital signs of Blood Pressure: 160/89mmHg, Pulse Rate: 91/min, Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 36℃, SPO2: 100％ under ambient air. Initially, laboratory data showed anemia, and impaired kidney function (Hb 9.0 g/dL, Cr:2.7 mg/dL). Hematologist was consulted for the factor XIII deficiency was suspected. Based on Factor XIII values mild decreased, it’s not qualified to use NHI of medication. Therefore, cryoprecipitate 20U was given on 2022/09/05 for suspected bleeding progressed (Hb 9.0 -> 8.0 g/dL). 

However, fever since 9/8-night, septic workup was done, while empirical Tazocin was prescribed. For persisting abdominal pain, followed abdominal radiography showed much stool materials.

[Plan]
=> Keep empiric Abx Tazocin(9/9-)
=> Check S/S, S/C, sputum AFS/mycobacterium culture x 3
=> Recheck U/A, if pyuria, will check U/C
=> f/u Hb level
=> Check autoimmune profile, anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, SS-A, SS-B
=> Check adrenal and thyroid functions.
=> Bisacodyl rectally for stool impaction
=> Component blood transfusion if needed
=> Record I/O, and check BW BIW(QW1+4)
=> Monitor sugar TIDAC+HS+PRN
=> Emphasize changing position and chest care importance to his foreign caregiver

was admitted to our ward due to cough with productive sputum for two years. 


The patient had received nasal irrigation with saline for years due to chronic sinusitis. The patient reported that intermittent cough with productive sputum had been noted since eight years ago. Because of hemoptysis developed five years ago, the patient visited Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Pulmonary function test revealed restrictive pattern. Although bronchodilator was provided, the symptoms persisted. Thus, the patient visited our outpatient department of pulmonary medicine on 2016/07/20. Computed tomography of chest taken on 2016/08/19 indicated bronchiectasis with bronchial thickening and sputum impaction at bilateral lung fields. Clarithromycin had been provided since 2016/08/24. However, the symptoms fluctuation were noted. Pulmonary function test performed on 2016/08/26 revealed mild-to-moderate restrictive ventilatory defect (FVC=64.2% of predictive value), which was irresponsive bronchodilator (10.30% increase), and normal diffusion capacity (DLCO=91.76 % of predictive value). Pulmonary function test performed on 2017/12/15 revealed mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory defect (FEF 25-75%/FVC=0.42; FEV1/FVC=0.71; FVC=75% of predictive value).However, cough, especially at night time, became more severe in August, 2018. Chest X-ray taken on 2018/08/27 indicated increased infiltration and fibrotic change at bilateral upper and lung fields. Spiriva (tiotropium) was provided for symptom relief. However, the computed tomography of chest taken on 2020/06/05 revealed an irregular nodule (~1 cm) associated with a calcification and pleural retraction at the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe in addition to bilateral bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis. The nodule was enlarged to 1.6 cm after chest computed tomography was taken on 2021/06/16. To rule out pulmonary infection of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterium, acid fast stain was collected on 2021/07/07, 07/08 and 07/09, which later reported negative result. Sputum culture collected on 2019/01/23, 2019/05/15 and 2021/07/08 revealed bacterial growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (wild type). 

The patient reported intermittent fever (up to 38.5oC), chest tightness and productive sputum for two years. Low back pain had been noted for seven months, which was relieved after rehabilitation. Rehabilitation physician suggested loss of intervertebral disc space of lumbar vertebrae. Body weight loss (3 kg within six months) and poor appetite were also noted. Physical examination indicated crackles at bilateral lung fields. She was admitted for CT-guided biopsy of tumor at left lower lung field and intravenous antibiotics therapy.

The patient has been totally ADL and iADL dependent due to traumatic brain injury since 2017. According to his family's statement, his baseline condition was consciousness of E2VTM4, body temperature around 35-36C (rarely up to 36'C), SBP about 100 mmHg, fed by NG tube, and diaper usage without Foley catheter. Productive sputum was noted for 10 days, for which the family tried Cefuroxime for 9 days, chest care, inhalation and sputum suction. However desaturation with purulent sputum was still noted at home, and he was thus brought to NTUH ER on 2023/08/07. 

At triage, his vital signs were as followed E2VTM3, blood pressure 101/64 mmHg, pulse rate 62/min, respiratory rate 19/min, temperature 35.7℃, and SPO2 100％. The CXR showed increased infiltration at bilateral lung fields and cardiomegaly. O2 supply, sputum suction, heat lamp, and septic work-up including sputum culture and blood culture were applied. Empirical Tazocin was prescribed for pneumonia. Under the impression of pneumonia, he was admitted for management.

On 08/09, prominent crackles were noted, more significantly on the left side, and the patient was on oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L. By 08/10, bilateral crackles had improved, and the patient could maintain SpO2 at 94-96% on ambient air. The patient experienced diarrhea suspected to be related to Tazocin on 08/09, but this issue was not further mentioned after the switch to Imipenem. A chest X-ray on 08/07 showed increased opacities at bilateral lung fields and cardiomegaly. The patient's condition was closely monitored, with stress dose Cortisone administered for pneumonia from 08/08. On 08/11, the patient had an episode of hypothermia with a body temperature of 33.5°C, for which a heating lamp was applied, and lab tests revealed CO2 retention with mild respiratory acidosis.

The patient was an ex-smoker, ADL and iADL totally independent at baseline. This time, the patient was found syncope again in our hospital at around 12:05 on 2022/10/06, when he attended to our hospital for pre-dialysis education. According to previous medical record, he had 5 episodes of syncope in the past 4 months; in 2022/01, 2022/02, 2022/03/12, 2022/03/28 and 2022/4/19. And the episode seemed not related to activity or specific events, according to the patient. Previous cardiac echo reported moderately dilated left ventricle, and normal LV systolic function (EF 56.3 %). 24hr holter EKG was installed on 2022/04/21-04/22, showing rare ventriclar ectopies and frequent supraventricular ectopies (2.4%). EEG performed on 2022/04/22 morning revealed focal epileptogenicity in the left frontal area and mild diffuse cortical dysfunction with emphasis in the left fronto-temporal areas. Carotid duplex done on 2022/04/22 afternoon showed mild atherosclerosis in bilateral carotid bulbs, left CCA, ICA without significant hemodynamic changes.

This tine, the patient reported about three days before admission, he felt poor appetite and nausea vomiting that he only had one meal a day in the past two days. He denied fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, but running nose for months without change. Today, the patient fainted during lunch time with his wife. There was no head injury noted or seizure like movement witness. About seconds later, the patient awaked spontaneously with clear conscious and was referred to our emergent department for evaluation. 

At emergent department, the patient's vital sign were: BP 158/78 mmHg, PR 60/min, Respirations 20/min, BT 36.1 degrees. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with heart rate 45 beats. Blood test showed metabolic acidosis(pH=7.22, HCO3=12), hyperkalemia (K:5.1 mmol/L), uremia(BUN=67 mg/dL) suspected acute on chronic kidney disease. There was no bleeding event found nor peripheral edema and fluid overload, with daily urination> 500ml/day. Chest X-ray showed left lower lung infiltration wihtout hemothorax or pneumothorax. COVID-19 screening showed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive with Ct value: 16.7 via nasal-pharyngeal swap. Under the impression of syncope, COVID-19, and uremia, the patient was admitted for further evaluation and management.

[Summary of this week]
After admission molnupiravir was prescribed for COVID-19. intermittent hemodialysis was arranged due to refractory acidosis and uremic syndrome. Double lumen was inserted at right femoral and the pateint started recieving dialysis since 2022/10/08. Severe anemia was noted but there was no obvious coffee ground and OB showed negative. Blood transufion was given suspected large ecchymosis over right femoral DLC wound side related. On 10/11 mild fever up to 37.6'C was found and culture was obtained. Cefepime was administered. On 10/12 blood culture yeild GPC so teicoplanin was given for profound shock status. On 10/13 blood culture yeild methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus so we discontinued teicoplanin and keep cefepime. On the same night septic shock developed and blood pressure was stablized after fluid resuscitation and albumin supply.

severe leg edema which cannot relieve after diuretic treatment for 6 months","MED: Patient is a 66-year-old patient with the underlying disease include
- chronic kidney disease stage 5
- neohrotic syndrome with edema and proteinuria, lab data showed urine protein 300 mg/dL 
- diabetes mellitus for more than 20 years, under medical treatment for 7 years
- hypertension, and the general systolic pressure is around 165mmHg
- Anemia, under treatment of erythropoietin every month 

Patient was diagnosised with type 2 diabetes for more than 20 years. However, he refused medical treatment but took the Chinese traditional medicine instead. Edema, significant weight lose, polydipsia and polyuria were noted since about 7 years ago. Therefore, patient seek for medical assistance at hospital. Lab data showed HbA1c 7.2% and fasting glucose 350 mg/dL. After regular follow-up and treatment, diabetes was well controlled recently, with the latest HbA1c 6.0% and fasting glucose 100 mg/dL. Patient suffered from macular degeneration and cataract, but futher management was postponed due to declined renal function. 

However, patient still suffered from intermittent leg edema for 7 years despite well controlled diabetes. Lab data 3 years ago revealed proteinuria, suspected diabetic nephropathy related nephrotic syndrome. It was controlled with diuretics then. Nevertheless, the latest edema 6 months ago, it couldn't be controlled with diuretics. 

Associated symptoms including chest tightness, occurred 3 months ago, with the slow onset. Chest tightness was mild, but would exacerbated when edema recurred and relieve by rest. Oliguria was noted, but it may caused by reduce water intake.

There were no symptoms of bleeding tendency, alter conscious status, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, tremor, hyperlipdemia, obesity, lower urinary tract symptom, cancer history, inherited kidney disease, fever, arthragia, oral ulcer, ascites, jaundice, hepatitis C or B, exposure of lead, pesticide or agricultural chemical. 

 Under the impression of progressing stage 5 chronic kidney disease, patient was admitted for preparation of dialysis.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until he was struck with fever and abdominal discomfort 2 years ago (2021). He sought medical help at our Hospital, where a renal sonography (2021/11/24) and abdomen-pelvis CT with/without contrast showed a right renal stone with right hydrocalyx during management for an episode of urinary tract infection at our hospital 2 years ago (2021/11/23). He was then referred to our Urology outpatient clinic, where intravenous urogram (IVU) (2021/12/21) showed right calyceal stones. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Elevated uric acid level was also noted. However, surgery was contraindicated due to his recent myocardial infarction. After consultation, our cardiologist agreed that the patient can withold his anti-platelet for surgery. After discussion, the patient agreed to surgery for his right renal stone.

The patient reported intermittent right flank soreness. He also reported an episode of gross hematuria 3 months ago (2022/10) and occasional pink urine. He denied symptoms of respiratory tract infection or urinary tract infection. He reported withholding his anti-platelet for 7 days.

This time, the patient is admitted to our Urology ward for surgery for his right renal stone.

According to the patient, he used to be under regular follow up at Cathay hospital for his hypertension since 2010. However, he lost follow up since 2019. An episode of acute back pain followed by intermittent pricking pain and back pain was noted since two months ago. The pain could not be alleviated nor aggravated upon any known factors. Fever, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, unilateral limbs weakness or numbness were denied. 

Due to persistent pain, the patient was brought to National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) emergency department on 2022/04/25. At triage, hypertension was noted, vital signs were otherwise stable. Lab data were generally within normal limits. Chest, abdomen and pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed aortic dissection from distal aortic arch to bilateral iliac arteries, with involvement of superior mesenteric artery and bilateral renal arteries. Perdipine and Trandate pump was administered for blood pressure control. Cardiovascular surgeon was contacted for evaluation. No emergent operation was needed. For strict blood pressure control, the patient was admitted to 5A ward for further suveillance.

After admission to 5A ward, CT was arranged and showed (1)Aortic dissection, Stanford type B from distal aortic arch to bilateral external iliac arteries. The superior mesenteric artery is also involved. The two renal arteries are from the false lumen. (2)A right renal tumor (2.8cm) with cystic portion and enhancing solid parts, suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Left renal cysts. Intravenous form antihypertensive, trandate and perdipine were administered. His systolic blood pressure (SBP) became lower to 150 mmHg. Medication was shifted to oral form including amlodipine, carvedilol and valsartan on 2022/4/27. Cardiac echo was done on 2022/04/28 and showed partial ruptured mitral valve chordae, posterior leaflet, with moderate mitral regurgitation. Doxazocin was added on 2022/4/30 because the SBP was sometimes above 150 mmHg. Follow up CT on 2022/05/02 showed stationary false lumen, and a 3.0cm right renal tumor, suspect renal cell carcinoma. Considering his resistant hypertension and renal tumor noted by CT, urology outpatient clinic was also arranged.

He visited NTUH urologist Dr. Huang's (黃國皓) outpatient clinic on 2022/05/05, 2022/05/19 seperately, and radiologist Dr. Liang's (梁博欽) outpatient clinic on 2022/05/14. After sufficient share decision making with the patient, transcatheter arterial embolization plus microwave ablation was arranged considering the patient's condition. Therefore, he was admitted to our ward on 2022/06/14 for preparation of the treatment.

【Present Illness】
This is a 15-year-old boy with the following history:
(1) Cerebellar tumor, medulloblastoma, WHO grade IV, high risk, status post sub-occipital craniectomy tumor excision, C1 laminectomy, Y' shaped durotomy Y, transvermian approach on 2020/04/08, status post Ventriculi-peritoneal shunt on 2020/04/15, status post concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CSI 3600 cGy + QW vincristine for 6 weeks, D1=2020/05/11-2020/06/22), status post TPOG MB 2019 Synopsis HR protocol CiE cycle (III) (C1D1=2020/08/19, C2D1=2020/10/02, C3D1=2020/11/14), under TPOG MB 2019 Synopsis HR protocol VCy cycle I (D1=2020/12/25, held due to fever; resume D2 on 12/29)
(2) Hydrocephalus, status post VP shunt at right on 2020/04/15

He was healthy and denied any systemic disease til 2020/02. He had vertigo and headache since 2020/02 for one month. Suddenly onset of vomiting and nausea was noted in late 2020/03. Hence, he was brought to 臺北市立聯合醫院 OPD for help. After survey, central dizziness was suspected by neurologist. CT on 2020/04/06 showed a nearly 6*4*4 cm midline posterior fossa tumor from roof of 4th ventricle protruding to expand 4th ventricle with obstructive hydrocephalus and mass effect over the brainstem and basilar artery. Cerebellar brain tumor was impressed. He was transferred to 國泰 hospital. After transferal, physical examination showed E4V6M5, pupil size 2.5/2.5 cm, light reflex +/+, full muscle power, no focal neurological sign. MRI on 2020/04/07 showed 6*4*4 cm T1-hypointense, mild T2/T2 FLAIR-hyperintense, marked-DW-hyperintense and herterogeneous contrast enhanceing midline mass lesion arising from the roof of 4th ventricle and protruding into the 4th ventricle with marked expansion. Then, he received bilateral suboccipital craniotomy, C1 laminectomy, Y shaped durotomy transvermiasn approach, tumor excison on 2020/04/08. Follow up CT showed 2020/04/13 showed persistent hydrocephalus. Hence, he received VP shunt implantation(median pressure: 7 mmHg) on 2020/04/15. Follow up neurological examination showed left side muslce power down 5/5/4/4. For post-OP care and CCRT, he was transferred to NTUH.

Brain MRI on 2020/04/24 showed no evidence of IICP, no residual tumor, and small amount of subdural hemorrhage overlying the right occipital areas. Lumbar punture was done on 2020/04/27, which showed CSF cytology negative. RT simulation was done, and CCRT was arranged on 2020/05/11. Other pre-chemo survey was done, which showed no abnormality. Spinal MRI on 2020/05/01 showed no definite signal change. We kept foley training and foley was removed on 2020/05/07. He tolerated CCRT well from 2020/05/11 to 2020/06/22 with QW vincristine and CSI 3600 cGy. Port-A was implanted smoothly on 2020/08/17. TPOG MB 2019 Synopsis HR chemotherapy of cycle 1 CiE was initiated from 2020/08/18. Nausea, vomiting and change in taste were noted afterwards. Side effects of chemotherapy included grade 4 neutropenia (ANC=57), grade 2 anemia (Hb=9.2) and grade 3 thrombocytopenia (PLT=13K). Mild decreased muscle power over left side (with improvement) and unsteady gait persisted. CiE cycle 3 was done smoothly from 2020/11/14 to 2020/11/17. MRI of brain and whole spine were performed on 2020/11/15 and 11/17, which showed stationary condition, no recurrence. There was one episode of neutropenic fever without infectious focus on 2020/12/02 night. Emprircial Tazocin and gentamicin were administered and fever subsided afterwards.

TPOG MB 2019 Synopsis HR protocol VCy cycle 1 was initated on 2020/12/25, however, fever without chills was noted on 2020/12/26 morning. He had sore throat and nausea was also noted. Physical examination showed mild injected throat with no exudate. Comflamm was given for symptom control. No culture evidence was noted and fever subsided later. We re-started chemotherapy Day2 on 2020/12/29. TPOG MB 2019 Synopsis HR protocol VCy cycle 2 was started on 2021/01/30. Only fever was noted at Vcy cycle 1 and 2.

This time, he is admitted for TPOG MB 2019 Synopsis HR protocol VCy cycle 3. He denied fever, URI symptom, GI symptom, headache or nausea recently. He had fair spirit and appetite.","PED: S:
