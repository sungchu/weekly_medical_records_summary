  The patient had undergone heart transplantation on 2004/02/13. He received regular EMB for evaluation of rejection status and showed no cellular rejection. He was admitted in 2019/12 due to dyspnea and aggravated heart failure. Sick sinus syndrome was suspected and he received pacemaker implantation then.

  According to his brother, general malaise, poor appetite, bilateral ankle swelling occurred for one week. Exertional dyspnea, oliguria, chest tightness was described for 2 days. Therefore, he was brought to our emergency department on 2022/02/21. On arrival, consciousness was clear E4V5M6. Vital signs were Blood Pressure: 135/103mmHg, Pulse Rate: 130/min, Respiratory Rate: 26/min, Temperature: 36¢J, SPO2: 98%, with Simple mask 6L/min. Wheezing, abdominal distension, bilateral pitting edema were observed on physical examination. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, bilateral minimal pleural effusion. EKG was suspicious pacing rhythm. ADHF was impressed(rejection-induced?), so Rasitol was given. Superimposed community-acquired pneumonia from COPD AE could not be excluded, and empirical Unasyn, bronchodilator were prescribed. Under the impression of acute deocompensated heart failure, he was admitted to general ward 5A on 2022/02/21 for further evaluation and management.

   After admission, KUB showed stool impaction without much bowel gas; therefore, stool softener, prokinetic were added. Recurrent hypoglycemia was shown, and D50W was injected.

- Give Keppra 1000 mg STAT, then 500 mg Q12H
- Close monitor his clinical conditions and neurologic status (GCS, Pupil, MP Q1H)
- Arrange brain CT angiography to rule out vacular lesion
- Survey and correct hyponatremia as your expertise
- Consider to arrange EEG
- Consider to arrange cardiac ECHO for rule out vegetation
- Due to the use of Bokey and Xarelto, high risk of progression of hemorrhage, deterioration of neurologic status and requirement of life-saving operation were informed to his brother. He understood.

The patient hit to the guardrail when was riding a motorcycle in ª÷¤s on 2021/07/28. He was riding with 80 km/hr with his helmet on. He denied lost of conscious nor nausea/vomit upon collision. He was sent to NTUH ª÷¤s hospital. Multiple abrasion wounds on the trunk and a 1cm-sized laceration wound on the left forehead was noted. Brain + Chest CT showed SDH over right frontotemporal area without brain midline shift and RUL contusion. He was then sent to NTUH Á`°| ER for further management.

Upon transfer, vitals were BP: 112/73mmHg, T:37.4¢J, P:104/min, R:18/min, SpO2:100¢H. Repeated brain CT showed signiicant progression of right frontotemporal SDH with midline shift. Mannitol, depakine and transamine were given and endotracheal tube was inserted. Neurosurgeon was consulted and the patient received right craniotomy and ICP insertion. This time, due to traumatic injury with right SDH and RUL contusion, the patient was admitted to our trauma ICU for further monitor.

After surgery; id est Right frontotemporal craniotomy for epidural hematoma removal et Intraparenchymal ICP monitoring right frontal lobe on 28th July. On the next day F/U CT showed stationary condition. Orthopedist was consulted as lumbar MRI is suggested if stable. 3% saline was added as a ICP-lowering agent. Weaning off ventilator was tried on 1st August and ended up smoothly weaned off on 3rd August. WBC was elevating w/o any leery infection focus. NS still suggested keeping ICP lowering agent. GCS had been 15 since weaning off MV. He had held good spirit. Some PVCs had been epsied. It would probably be frivolous to do more than closely monitoring. We quit prescribing CFP because of complete course and lack of evidence on 7th AUG. We are pending 6B to take over to attend to thsi p't since 5th AUG.","2021-08-09

On 08/10, an L-spine MRI was performed, which revealed bilateral L5 pars interarticularis spondylolysis. The patient has been kept on a back brace for lumbar support and has been receiving physical therapy. By 08/12, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, pulse of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg. The patient's pain has been controlled, and oral intake has been tolerated without issues. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's neurological status closely, controlling pain, and applying the back brace for lumbar support. Additionally, the patient is scheduled for a transfer to the general ward, and preparations are being made for potential discharge, with discussions regarding post-acute care (PAC) rehabilitation plans."

 The patient received the heavy treatment for his colon cancer at ¥_ºa as above mentioned since 2018/12 and decided not to receive further chemotherapy since 2022/4 for palliative reason. He was regular followed up at family medicine OPD at ¥x¤j¥_Å@. Dating back his medical history, he initially noted abnormal CEA level (188) from the worker's health examination without any specific discomfort in 2018. He denied body weight loss, GI discomfort, constipation or diarrhea as initial presentation. 

 For the recent 4 days he noticed no stool passage and abdominal fullness, and he also had nausea sensation. He came to family medicine OPD at ¥x¤j¥_Å@ and was referred to NTUH emergency department on 2022/5/11 under the impression of ileous. At triage, his vital signs remained relatively stable (Blood Pressure: 142/84mmHg, Pulse Rate: 70/min, Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 36.7¢J, SPO2: 99¢H ). Lab data showed hypokalemia and mild anemia. CT on 2022/5/11 revealed ileus with suspicious tumor recurrence over anastomosis site, proximal colon dilatation and distal retum collapsing, with left hydronephrosis. General surgeon was consulted. On 2022/5/14, he underwent cystoscope for left DBJ stent insertion but but the guidewire could not pass through left ureterovesical junction (UVJ), suspect left UVJ to lower ureter stricture and torsion related to post-op adhesion and recurrent tumor. He also received open surgery and revealed dilated small bowel loops and A-colon with small bowel adhesion and abdominal wall tumor via the right lower paramedian incision. Loop ileostomy was made. After the operation, the patient was admitted to our ward for postoperative care and management.

General condition: fair 
No fever was noted. 
However high CRP level (12) and hypokalemia was noted. 

He tolerates full diet well.

General condition: fair 
No fever was noted. 

He tolerates full diet well. 

CT was performed to evulate the condition of peri-stoma abdominal wall asbcess. The abscess was limited and some pus at the medial aspect of the stoma was not drained. I have discussed with stoma care team about its management. 

I also perfomed bedside decompression of colon content yesterday but the effect was limited.

On 05/17, the patient started a soft diet and received Tazocin for better GNB coverage due to erythematous change around the ileostomy. By 05/21, the patient's condition was fair, with no fever noted, and the patient tolerated a full diet well. On 05/23, the antibiotic was shifted to Invanz and Metronidazole, and an anal tube was inserted via ileostomy to the A-colon. However, the anal tube was removed on 05/26 due to malfunction. The patient's discharge was prepared, and the patient was educated on how to care for the ileostomy. Pain control was also managed, and the patient's condition was closely monitored. As of 05/26, the patient's hypo-K had resolved, and the drain amount and character were being monitored."

After discharge from last admission since 2023/04/11, the patient remain stable. PTCD had been smooth with dark green bile drained everyday. However, dizziness with hypotension was ntoed on 2023/05/16 morning. Dyspnea (platypnea)and general malaise were also reported. She then visited our ER. Upon triage, vital signs were as following: BP 90/55mmHg, HR 64/min, RR 20/min, BT 36.1¢J, SPO2: 99%. Lab data showed hemoconcentration (Hb 16, Hct 48.3%), no leukocytosis (WBC: 7.85K), elevated total biirubin (Tbil 3.41) and worsened renal function (Cre: 2.3). Moreover, hyperammonia (NH3 113), hyponatremia (Na 121) and hyperkalemia (K 5.4) was noted. Troponin-T was also high (22.38ng/L) with atrial fibrillation showed upon EKG. Blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.23, HCO3 16.2) with normal lactic acid level. Saline, Kalimate, diuretics were given for AKI and eletrolyte imbalance. Sodium bicarbonate was given for metabolic acidosis. Glypressin and albumin were also administered for hepatorenal syndrome. Rechecked troponin-T later decreased to 17.69ng/L.

Due to consequence of AKI, including electrolyte imbalance and metabolic acidosis, the patient was admitted to our ward for further care.

On 05/17, the patient's troponin-T level was high at 22.38ng/L, and atrial fibrillation was noted on EKG. The patient was given saline, Kalimate, diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, Glypressin, and albumin to manage AKI, electrolyte imbalance, and metabolic acidosis. By 05/18, the patient's condition worsened, with hypotension and hypovolemic shock, and Levophed was administered. A CVC was inserted on 05/18 for Levophed infusion. The patient's hyperkalemia and hyponatremia were resolved, and the patient was started on Cefepime and Targocid for suspected infection. On 05/18, hospice and palliative care consultation was initiated, and the patient's family agreed to a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. The patient's condition remains critical, with a high risk of mortality, and the focus of care has shifted to symptom management and palliative care."

Due to TBI with cerebellar ICH he was admitted to ICU for close surveillance. Before admission his consciousness fully regained. Due to stationary status he was transferred to ward on 5/13. We kept rehabilitation and discussed with his son about further disposition. Left foot mild pain wound was noted. However the wound has healed with eschar formation. Lab data showed mild leukocytosis and Curam was given. However redness around the wound was noted after few days and antibiotics were switched to Unasyn for the concern of cellulitis. His left foot wound showed much improvement. However follow-up data still showed leukocytosis with elevated CRP level. He denied URI nor GU symptoms. Only mild abdomen pain was complained. We upgrade antibiotics to Tazocin and abdomen echo was arranged for survey of occult infection nor inflammation.

Right-sided weakness developed from proximal thigh to distal foot gradually within one month.","SURG: [Present illness]
This is a 46-year-old woman with a past history notable for:
 1. Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III, left frontal lobe, status post grossly total tumor excision on 2010/12/03
 2. Seizure, with lamotrigine
 3. Myoma, stable, noted for 4 years

Trace back her medical history, she had her first seizure attack in 2010, when she was pregnant for 13+ weeks. She had underwent biopsy at VGH and showed anaplastic astrocytoma. She then visited NTUH for surgical intervention, grossly total excision of brain tumor via left
frontal craniotomy was performed on 2010/12/03. Upon discharge, she followed-up regularly at outpatient clinic and showed no recurrence until this year.

In 2023/10, she complaint about weakness developed gradually from her right proximal thigh to distal end of lower extremities within one month. For her worsening symptoms, she visited NTUH emergency department on 2023/11/06. Upon triage, her vital signs were as followed, BP 145/82mmHg, PR 80/min, RR 18/min, T 36.7¢J, SPO2 96¢H, GCS score was E4M6V5. Neurological examination showed muscle power was RA/RL/LA/LL = 3/2/5/5. Lab data showed no remarkable findings for CK, vitamin B12, folic Acid, HBV, HCV, VDRL, HIV, TSH, fT4. SSEP showed prolonged absolute latencies of cortical SEPs from both tibial nerves. Cervical spine showed cervical spondylosis at C5-6. Brain CT without contrast showed post-operative change and ill-defined hypodenisity at left frontal lobe. Brain MRI showed a new heterogeneous enhancing nodule in left frontal lobe, suspect recurrent tumor. 

Under the impression of left frontal lobe tumor, suspect recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma, she wad admitted to 8D ward for further management.

 She was referred to cardiology clinic for the survey of the origin of embolus on 2019/05/24. A grade 2 early diastolic murmur was heard at aortic area. Heart echo on 2019/06/05 showed ventricular septal defect status post repair without residual shunt, previous operation of pulmonary artery banding with peak pressure gradient of 33 mmHg. Moderately dilated RA and RV. Moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe pulmonic regurgitation was noted. TRPG was 71 mmHg. EKG-gated wide volume cardiovascular structural angiogram was doned on 2019/06/24 revealed no residual VSD s/p pulmonary banding, dilated RA/RV, may present pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation. A tiny patent foramen ovale (PFO) was suspected. For the management for pulmonary hypertension, she received percutaneous transluminal angioplasy to MPA on 2019/9/12. No pressure gradient was noticed before and after the PA banding site.
 Recently, she complained palpitation and mild exertional dyspnea. She denied orthopnea but dry cough recently. UCG on 2021/09/23 showed dilated RA, RV, moderate PR and residual supravalvular PS at previous banding site. Under the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, with moderate pulmonary regugitation(PG:28mmHg) and supravalvular residual pulmonary stenosis(PG:34mmHg), she was admitted for EKG-gated wide volume cardiovascular structural angiogram on 11/23and pulmonary valve replacemnt on 11/24.

Oral lasix and diovan 40mg QD were added on 2021/11/26. Transient bradycardia down to HR 44 was noted at night during sleep but recovered spontaneously. Transient second degree AV block (Mobitz type 1) was recorded for =5 minutes on 11/27 morning without symptoms. In a stable condition she was transferred to general ward on 2021/11/27. Transcient bradycardia was noted several times but her BP was stable and she had no complains. Drains and foley was removed on 11/29 and followed CXR showed improvement of bilateral lung opacity.

 He was diagnosed of left tongue squamous cell carcinoma in 2019/09, and was regularly followed up at oncologist's OPD in NTUH. During his follow-up, computed tomography was done in 2023/03, which revealed a large necrotic infiltrative mass at left lower neck with skin, thyroid gland invasion and clavicular head bone destruction and pathological fracture, about 5.7cm on axial view, and the left common carotid artery was encased and the left internal jugular vein is obliterated. He was then referred to CV surgeon for evaluation. This time, he was admitted to our ward for left common carotid artery stent grafting.

Duty note: fever and hypotension/nI was called at 5/11 21:30 due to fever up to 38.8'C. Due to suspected post-op inflammation status antipyretics was given first. However the patient complained of dizziness when lying on bed at around 22:40. We checked his vital signs which showed still fever up to 38'C and hypotension (BP:70/43mmHg rechecked BP:48/31mmHg). The patient consciousness was clear. He reported improved dizziness and denied headache chills dyspnea abdominal pain or dysuria. Septic shock was suspected and septic workup was done. Fluid challenge with norm-saline 500cc was given. Senior resident R4¾HÃ­²ø was contacted for evaluation. Levophed 8mg in 250cc D5W and Tazocin were administered.
