Hypertension\r\n\r\n  The patient had undergone heart transplantation on 2004/02/13. He received regular EMB for evaluation of rejection status and showed no cellular rejection. He was admitted in 2019/12 due to dyspnea and aggravated heart failure. Sick sinus syndrome was suspected and he received pacemaker implantation then.\r\n\r\n  According to his brother, general malaise, poor appetite, bilateral ankle swelling occurred for one week. Exertional dyspnea, oliguria, chest tightness was described for 2 days. Therefore, he was brought to our emergency department on 2022/02/21. On arrival, consciousness was clear E4V5M6. Vital signs were Blood Pressure: 135/103mmHg, Pulse Rate: 130/min, Respiratory Rate: 26/min, Temperature: 36℃, SPO2: 98%, with Simple mask 6L/min. Wheezing, abdominal distension, bilateral pitting edema were observed on physical examination. Chest radiography showed pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, bilateral minimal pleural effusion. EKG was suspicious pacing rhythm. ADHF was impressed(rejection-induced?), so Rasitol was given. Superimposed community-acquired pneumonia from COPD AE could not be excluded, and empirical Unasyn, bronchodilator were prescribed. Under the impression of acute deocompensated heart failure, he was admitted to general ward 5A on 2022/02/21 for further evaluation and management.\r\n\r\n   After admission, KUB showed stool impaction without much bowel gas; therefore, stool softener, prokinetic were added. Recurrent hypoglycemia was shown, and D50W was injected.\r\n\r\nFamily History: no associated family history\r\nMedication Allergy: denied\r\nMedication ADR: denied\r\nAllergy to Medical Device and Materials: denied \r\nCurrent Medication:\r\n 台大醫院:\r\nRasitol Inj 20 mg/2 mL /amp 20 mg STAT IV 1 days\r\nAtrovent Neb Soln 250 mcg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp STAT IH 1 days\r\n警 Vitagen 50% 20 mL/amp 40 mL STAT IV 1 days\r\nBricanyl Neb Soln 2.5 mg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp STAT IH 1 days\r\n警 Vitagen 50% 20 mL/amp 80 mL STAT IV 1 days\r\n警 Vitagen 50% 20 mL/amp 40 mL STAT IV 1 days\r\nUnasyn (based on ampicillin content) 1000 mg/vial 1000 mg STAT IV 1 days\r\nRasitol Inj 20 mg/2 mL /amp 20 mg Q8H IV 2 days\r\nBricanyl Neb Soln 2.5 mg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp Q6H IH 2 days\r\nUnasyn (based on ampicillin content) 1000 mg/vial 1000 mg Q8H IV 2 days\r\nAtrovent Neb Soln 250 mcg/1 mL 2 mL/amp 1 amp Q6H IH 2 days\r\n1.25 Concor 1.25 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\r\n160 Diovan FC 160 mg/tab 1 tab BID PO 28 days\r\nSR Diltelan SR 120 mg/cap 1 cap BID PO 28 days\r\n75 Plavix 75 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nLipitor 20 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nEzetrol 10 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nLipanthyl Supra FC 160 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nAspirin 100 mg/tab 1 tab QDPC PO 28 days\r\nFeburic 80 mg/tab 1 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nKascoal 40 mg/tab 1 tab TIDPC PO 28 days\r\nPredonine 5 mg/tab 0.5 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nAmaryl 2 mg/tab 2 tab QD PO 28 days\r\nLoditon 500 mg/tab 1 tab BIDPC PO 28 days\r\nQtern FC /tab 1 tab QAM PO 28 days\r\n25 Sandimmun Neoral 25 mg/cap 2 cap BID PO 28 days\r\nCellCept 250 mg/cap 6 cap BID PO 28 days\r\n Other: denied\r\n 中草藥: denied\r\n 保健食品: denied\r\nPast Medical History:\r\nHospitalization: 入院日期:2020_12_11 出院日期:2020_12_19 診斷:Heart transplant\r\n\r\nPast Surgical History:\r\n\r\nLifestyle:\r\nAlcohol consumption: binge drinking for 10+ years\r\nBetel nut chewing: denied\r\nCigarette smoking: 10 cigarettes per day for 20+ years\r\n\r\nTravel history: denied\r\nOccupation: unknown\r\nContact history: denied\r\nCluster histroy: denied",

On 03/15, Vancomycin was initiated to treat the C. difficile infection, which was diagnosed after a stool culture was performed due to the patient's persistent diarrhea. The patient's hypoglycemia is suspected to be caused by clopidogrel induced autoimmune syndrome. Hyperbilirubinemia is present, with dilated hepatic cysts and IVC, suspected to be nutmeg liver. The patient's coronary artery disease is suspected to be related to cardiac allograft vasculopathy, with a history of PCI and stenting to LCX. Bilateral multiple embolic infarction with hemorrhagic transformation caused diffuse intracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an ICH score of 2, suspected to be related to atrial fibrillation. By 03/24, the patient's anemia had worsened, requiring a 2-unit transfusion of packed red blood cells. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with plans for potential transfer to a physical medicine and rehabilitation ward."

    "LLM_BRIEFSUMMARY": "This week, the patient's condition has been closely monitored following the traumatic brain injury with skull fracture and epidural hemorrhage status post right frontotemporal craniotomy for epidural hematoma removal and cranial fixation. On 08/10, an L-spine MRI was performed, which revealed bilateral L5 pars interarticularis spondylolysis. The patient has been kept on a back brace for lumbar support and has been receiving physical therapy. By 08/12, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.7簞C, pulse of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg. The patient's pain has been controlled, and oral intake has been tolerated without issues. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's neurological status closely, controlling pain, and applying the back brace for lumbar support. Additionally, the patient is scheduled for a transfer to the general ward, and preparations are being made for potential discharge, with discussions regarding post-acute care (PAC) rehabilitation plans."

He was regular followed up at family medicine OPD at 台大北護. Dating back his medical history, he initially noted abnormal CEA level (188) from the worker's health examination without any specific discomfort in 2018. He denied body weight loss, GI discomfort, constipation or diarrhea as initial presentation. \r\n\r\n For the recent 4 days he noticed no stool passage and abdominal fullness, and he also had nausea sensation. He came to family medicine OPD at 台大北護 and was referred to NTUH emergency department on 2022/5/11 under the impression of ileous. At triage, his vital signs remained relatively stable (Blood Pressure: 142/84mmHg, Pulse Rate: 70/min, Respiratory Rate: 20/min, Temperature: 36.7℃, SPO2: 99％ ). Lab data showed hypokalemia and mild anemia. CT on 2022/5/11 revealed ileus with suspicious tumor recurrence over anastomosis site, proximal colon dilatation and distal retum collapsing, with left hydronephrosis. General surgeon was consulted. On 2022/5/14, he underwent cystoscope for left DBJ stent insertion but but the guidewire could not pass through left ureterovesical junction (UVJ), suspect left UVJ to lower ureter stricture and torsion related to post-op adhesion and recurrent tumor. He also received open surgery and revealed dilated small bowel loops and A-colon with small bowel adhesion and abdominal wall tumor via the right lower paramedian incision. Loop ileostomy was made.

By 05/21, the patient's condition was fair, with no fever noted, and the patient tolerated a full diet well. On 05/23, the antibiotic was shifted to Invanz and Metronidazole, and an anal tube was inserted via ileostomy to the A-colon. However, the anal tube was removed on 05/26 due to malfunction. The patient's discharge was prepared, and the patient was educated on how to care for the ileostomy. Pain control was also managed, and the patient's condition was closely monitored. As of 05/26, the patient's hypo-K had resolved, and the drain amount and character were being monitored."

PTCD had been smooth with dark green bile drained everyday. However, dizziness with hypotension was ntoed on 2023/05/16 morning. Dyspnea (platypnea)and general malaise were also reported. She then visited our ER. Upon triage, vital signs were as following: BP 90/55mmHg, HR 64/min, RR 20/min, BT 36.1℃, SPO2: 99%. Lab data showed hemoconcentration (Hb 16, Hct 48.3%), no leukocytosis (WBC: 7.85K), elevated total biirubin (Tbil 3.41) and worsened renal function (Cre: 2.3). Moreover, hyperammonia (NH3 113), hyponatremia (Na 121) and hyperkalemia (K 5.4) was noted. Troponin-T was also high (22.38ng/L) with atrial fibrillation showed upon EKG. Blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.23, HCO3 16.2) with normal lactic acid level. Saline, Kalimate, diuretics were given for AKI and eletrolyte imbalance. Sodium bicarbonate was given for metabolic acidosis. Glypressin and albumin were also administered for hepatorenal syndrome. Rechecked troponin-T later decreased to 17.69ng/L.\r\n\r\nDue to consequence of AKI, including electrolyte imbalance and metabolic acidosis, the patient was admitted to our ward for further care.\r\n\r\n[Personal history]\r\n1.

Myoma, stable, noted for 4 years\r\n\r\nTrace back her medical history, she had her first seizure attack in 2010, when she was pregnant for 13+ weeks. She had underwent biopsy at VGH and showed anaplastic astrocytoma. She then visited NTUH for surgical intervention, grossly total excision of brain tumor via left\r\nfrontal craniotomy was performed on 2010/12/03. Upon discharge, she followed-up regularly at outpatient clinic and showed no recurrence until this year.\r\n\r\nIn 2023/10, she complaint about weakness developed gradually from her right proximal thigh to distal end of lower extremities within one month. For her worsening symptoms, she visited NTUH emergency department on 2023/11/06. Upon triage, her vital signs were as followed, BP 145/82mmHg, PR 80/min, RR 18/min, T 36.7℃, SPO2 96％, GCS score was E4M6V5. Neurological examination showed muscle power was RA/RL/LA/LL = 3/2/5/5. Lab data showed no remarkable findings for CK, vitamin B12, folic Acid, HBV, HCV, VDRL, HIV, TSH, fT4. SSEP showed prolonged absolute latencies of cortical SEPs from both tibial nerves. Cervical spine showed cervical spondylosis at C5-6. Brain CT without contrast showed post-operative change and ill-defined hypodenisity at left frontal lobe. Brain MRI showed a new heterogeneous enhancing nodule in left frontal lobe, suspect recurrent tumor. \r\n\r\nUnder the impression of left frontal lobe tumor, suspect recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma, she wad admitted to 8D ward for further management. \r\n\r\n[Past medical history]\r\n1.

Due to suspected post-op inflammation status antipyretics was given first. However the patient complained of dizziness when lying on bed at around 22:40. We checked his vital signs which showed still fever up to 38'C and hypotension (BP:70/43mmHg rechecked BP:48/31mmHg). The patient consciousness was clear. He reported improved dizziness and denied headache chills dyspnea abdominal pain or dysuria. Septic shock was suspected and septic workup was done. Fluid challenge with norm-saline 500cc was given. Senior resident R4鄧穩莊 was contacted for evaluation. Levophed 8mg in 250cc D5W and Tazocin were administered.\r\n\r\n[Impression]\r\n# Hypotension suspected septic or hypovolemic shock\r\n# Fever suspected post-op inflammation or infection-related\r\n# Anemia suspect hemodilution/bleeding\r\n\r\nLab:\r\n2023/05/11 HB:6.2g/dL ---> anemia\r\n2023/05/11 WBC:5.24K/μL\r\n2023/05/11 PLT:160K/μL\r\n2023/05/11 BUN:11.8mg/dL\r\n2023/05/11 CRE:0.8mg/dL\r\n2023/05/11 T-BIL:0.43mg/dL\r\n2023/05/11 ALT:7U/L\r\n2023/05/11 K:3.9mmol/L\r\n2023/05/11 Na:135mmol/L\r\n2023/05/11 hsCRP:4.51mg/dL ---> elevated CRP\r\n\r\nUrine: pending\r\n\r\nCXR: increased bilateral lung markings\r\n\r\nBedside echo:\r\n\r\n[Plan]\r\n1.
